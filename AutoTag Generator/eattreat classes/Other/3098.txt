3098	No Leftovers! Rasoi On Wheels Serves Freshly Cooked Meals To Needy In Delhi	<p>While for most of us charity involves giving away leftover food to the poor or hungry, one Delhi-based restaurant is going a step ahead and serving fresh meals. This ‘restaurant’ is a old Maruti Van that has been converted into a food van that delivers meals to those in need.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>Around 11,000 meals were distributed in the first month itself, and now this charity has seen many benefactors coming forward and contributing. The restaurant is operational through a 800 sq ft kitchen that makes hot meals because no one really deserves to eat leftovers. A standard meal can include the likes of dal, roti, chhole, Kadhi-Chawal, Rajma-Chawal, noodles and more.</p><p>They have been serving more than 30,000 meals per day these. In fact at INR 35 a meal, anyone can approach them and sponsor a meal for school kids, underprivileged children, construstruction workers and more.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13490680_246336469071450_6610398284557543132_o.jpg"><img title = "No Leftovers!
