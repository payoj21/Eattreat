3167	UPDATE // Theobroma Is Coming To DLF Mall Of India!	<p class="S3l">Our favourite Bombay bakery Theobroma, is thinking of expansion plans and we couldn&#8217;t be happier. Mostly because those plans could possibly involve an outlet coming up at DLF Mall of India!</p><p class="S3l" style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p class="S3l">Theobroma Foods Pvt. Ltd is a Mumbai-based bakery, patisserie, and chocolaterie that is currently owned and managed by a Parsi family that does the gooiest brownies and blondies. A round of funding for this iconic spot founded by Kainaz Messman Harchandrai could mean that they do more products at a bunch of new places.</p><p class="S3l"><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/12976778_10153952359285991_3708057633778138097_o.jpg"><img title = "UPDATE // Theobroma Is Coming To DLF Mall Of India!

Looking to raise about $5-$6 million, Theobroma will double the number of outlets in Mumbai and enter the bakery market (more for us!) in our very own &#8211; New Delhi.</p><p class="S3l">Rest assured, instead of going the franchise way, the family will own, make and sell all of the products on their own.</p><h4 class="S3l" style="text-align: center;"><strong>EDIT</strong></h4><p class="S3l">They already have a profile on Theobroma up on Zomato and word has it that they&#8217;ll be here in the next six months. Are you excited or are you excited?</p><p class="S3l">Explore the patisserie <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theobromaindia/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="S3l"><em>Read the full story <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Companies/anT0qaoDPFrtXw8Y4WqsfO/Theobroma-Foods-in-fundraising-talks-with-PE-investors.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
