He humbly dedicated this achievement to his mentor and mentioned that the main aim of this was to bring back the lost recipes where food was cooked without sugar, refined oil, artificial colours and maida. Through this marathon, he wanted to promote Sangakala Tamil Unavu. “It was a challenging task as we had to brave the weather and frequent power cuts. Surveillance camera failed once and the time lost had to be compensated,” he told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p><p>This unbelievable achievement is a milestone for the industry and is definitely a treat to the eyes &amp; ears!</p>
