This means that now you can not only get an auto-wallah to your location, but also freshly cooked meals! So wish for an auto rickshaw and they&#8217;ll deliver your lunch too!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Jugnoo has launched Meals, their ready-to-eat food delivery service in Gurgaon. They’ve got lunch and dinner options and the food will be prepared in their in-house kitchen, and will be delivered by the team.</p><p>One can complete their payment through e-wallets and go completely cashless. Jugnoo says that they’ve seen a 100% peak in online payments after the demonetization drive. At the moment, they’re receiving about a 100 orders per day, and hope to bring this up to 500 orders in a month.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></p><p>The timings for you to order your meal is quite flexible. You can order  between 12.30 pm and 4.30 pm, and they&#8217;ll deliver your lunch, and dinner between 7.30 pm and 10.30 pm, which, we feel are wide enough time slots for anyone to get their food. They also give you the option of choosing your delivery slot so that you’ll always get warm food delivered to your door. Additionally, the food isn’t very oily and is low on spice to make it a slightly healthier option for those who order in every day.</p><p>Jugnoo has already started serving in Chandigarh and Jaipur. They say that venturing into Gurgaon was quick and easy. They’ve also kept in mind the situation of auto rickshaws in the city, and the idea is to keep the drivers profitably engaged.</p><p>They aim to delivery your lunch at affordable rates to people who relocate to the city from other places. Their menu changes every day, so you won’t end up eating the same thing every day.</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://www.hospitalitybizindia.com/detailNews.aspx?aid=25979&amp;sid=23" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p><p>Explore Jugnoo <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jugnoose/?hc_ref=SEARCH&amp;fref=nf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
