3820	Heartwarming Videos By KFC Are Talking About Something Important – Hunger	<p>Working with Ogilvy Delhi, KFC has launched a digital campaign called “You eat, They eat”. This is part of the HOPE initiative, where KFC is going to contribute INR 5 from every bucket that you buy. We are loving the tone of each of the videos created for this campaign. Without being overtly sympathetic or condescending, the videos get the point across through Gopal, Gita, Raju and Pinky’s stories.</p><p>Have a look here.</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rs9ybQNeAfo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Raising awareness about one of the most crippling problems in India—hunger and scavenging—KFC is trying to combat it in its own way. Rahul Shinde spoke about the campaign saying, “Hunger is a very real and big challenge &#8211; at least 3,000 children die every day from poor diet related illness. The fact that millions of children go to bed hungry every night means that they are unable to grow, learn and thrive. It is a critical cause to unite behind.”</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F8M7mW3NvX8?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each bucket now has the possibility of reaching out to a hungry child. We are absolutely onboard this idea, and Ajay Gahlaut elaborates on the idea of using the bucket as the messenger of this technology-led campaign. “We created animated films about underprivileged kids that play only when you order and scan a bucket.”</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUua3heWeVA?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>We’re ordering a bucket for our next meal.
