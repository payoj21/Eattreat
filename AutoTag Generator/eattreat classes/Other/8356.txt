8356	Gurgaon Rooftop And Outdoor Restaurants Can Now Serve Alcohol On A 10% Fee!	<p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57114">The sealing of all the rooftop areas of cafes and restaurants at Connaught Place and the news of alcohol ban in Cyberhub, Gurgaon has let down many Delhiites as well as restauranteurs. With authorities, becoming more vigilant about terrace and rooftop restaurant areas, even places like HKV and Khan Market have come under the radar. Some of the cafes and restaurants there, have decided to keep their terraces shut as well in this whole situation.&nbsp;Rooftop bars in Gurgaon might have some good news though.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57116"><strong>But Here&#8217;s Something Positive</strong></h4><p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57117">There might be a positive change soon as last year in December, Excise Department released a circular which stated that all the restaurants in Gurgaon will be allowed to serve alcohol in their outdoor and terrace areas only on the payment of 10% of their liquor license fee.</p><p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57118">According to the restaurateurs, the policies in Haryana are much clearer and better. Since December&#8217;16 itself, the Excise Department of India has already received applications from approximately 30-40 restaurants and some of them have already passed. Currently, all restaurants and cafes in Gurgaon are allowed to only serve food and no alcohol at their terrace or rooftop area. As soon as all the restaurants who have paid the fee to the department and have completed the 10% requirement that are stated to be fulfilled, Gurgaon will be able to serve liquor in their open-air dining areas.</p><h4><strong>#RestauranteurSpeak&nbsp;</strong></h4><p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57120">&#8220;There are around 10 requirements for us to fulfil in the memo and most restaurants in Cyber Hub have paid the additional fee in January, and are awaiting the final response from the Excise Department. The last point states that &#8216;while recommending the case for granting additional point in an open space, the map of the open space shall be personally certified by the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner&#8217;. So once that is done, restaurants that have already fulfilled the criteria can legally serve alcohol on terraces.<span id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57121">&nbsp;</span>I have four outlets, and for two of them (in Cyber Hub and DLF Phase IV), I have paid the fee and completed the formalities. Once we have the permission, we&#8217;ll be free to use the open area for serving guests. The annual license fee for restaurants in Gurgaon to serve liquor is Rs 12.5 lakh. The 10% comes to Rs 1.25 lakh, which most of the restaurants have deposited with the department &#8221; says&nbsp;<span id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57123">Rahul Singh</span>, vice president of the&nbsp;<span id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57125">National Restaurants Association of India</span>&nbsp;(NRAI) and owner of Beer Cafe said to TOI.</p><p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57120">&nbsp;Gurgaon really needs this according to many restaurateurs because they believe maximum crowd at these restaurants and cafes are corporate employees who are spending their whole day in air-conditioned rooms and want to have a drink outdoor while enjoying their food.</p><p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57127"><i id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57131"><strong>Read full story&nbsp;<a id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57132" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/finally-you-can-dine-and-wine-on-the-terrace-in-gurgaon/articleshow/57148626.cms" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/finally-you-can-dine-and-wine-on-the-terrace-in-gurgaon/articleshow/57148626.cms&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1487481460456000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQvwNbEUVSYg8nbuDXlnWGlU8AgQ">here</a>.</strong><u></u></i></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Beer Cafe</strong></em></p><p id="m_-247836496296266035yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_57130">&nbsp;</p>
