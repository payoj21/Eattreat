7179	Finally, Uber Is Launching UberEats In India, An On-Demand Delivery App	<p>In a über cool development, Uber is now going to launch its on-demand food delivery app UberEATS in India!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things first</strong></h4><p>The service currently exists in 58 cities since its launch in 2014 in Los Angeles. They’ve expanded to places like Bangkok, Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei too.</p><p>They’re currently looking to set up a network of restaurant partners, delivery partners, and restaurants at the moment. Allen Penn, the Asia Pacific head of UberEATS is very excited to bring the service to India. He says that it’s going to be a significant investment and the service is going to span multiple cities and regions and will have the potential to change the food industry in India at the push of a button, in the most vibrant of food cultures in the world.</p><p>UberEATS is going to be powered by the same technology that goes into the making their transport app efficient and cost effective. Getting great food delivered to you will be as easy as requesting a ride with the UberEATS app.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>However, the app is standalone and won’t have anything to do with the transport services. We’re guessing that it means you can’t order from within the app and that you’ll probably have to download UberEATS separately. In the cities that it currently operates, UberEats offers a few dishes that can be delivered quickly in a given area.</p><p>Ola too had set up a food delivery app called Ola Café in April 2015 but had to shut down within a year because of the fierce competition from other standalone food delivery apps. Food delivery is quite a competitive space in the country, and as restaurateurs and foodies get used to it, retaining clients is the biggest challenge.</p><p>Read the full story <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/uber-to-launch-food-delivery-app-ubereats-in-india/articleshow/56733784.cms" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UberEATS/" target="_blank">UberEATS</a>.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:<strong> UberEATS</strong></em></p>
