We strongly recommend taking a rickshaw from a known point, so you can sit back and enjoy the beauty of these narrow gulleys. Also, be prepared to head back to the hotel after, because you are going to be stuffed like a paratha!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kulcha Land </strong></h4><p>No Punjabi can forget <strong>kulchas</strong> while on a food excursion.

They often get limited by their food quantities rather than their customers, so we suggest heading here early. These no-fuss kulche are just the mouthful you need.</p><p><b>#EatExtra:</b> While popular amongst the locals, it is lesser known for most. Located in Chattiwind Darwazza, Near Shaeedan Wala Gurudwara, its best to get an auto rickshaw while headed here and avoid any navigation hassles.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
