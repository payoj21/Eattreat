An old gem, which has won multiple accolades, is finally expanding horizons and stepping up in the modern world by adapting to technology and keeping up with the times.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First </strong></p><p>Old Delhi’s beloved confectionery house, Chaina Ram never seemed interested in expansion. Always adhering to their traditional methods, recipes and values, getting them to change their minds seemed next to impossible.</p><p>If you wanted to grab a puri aloo breakfast you had to be here before 11am, to get bulk orders you had to call at least 10 days prior and pick it up at their convenience. But it has always been worth every bit of struggle, because in the end, they serve food which will make you smile for days on end.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Now?</strong></p><p>However, now they have accommodated their huge group of followers by launching an online website for delivery in Delhi NCR. Not only delivering mithai, you can also order savoury namkeen and snacks (say yes to paneer pakora!). Though they do have an additional delivery charge but let&#8217;s be real &#8211; a flat charge of INR 150 to get that delicious ghevar and chole to our homes is next to nothing!</p><p>Explore more <a href="http://chainaram.com\" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Chaina Ram Sindhi Confectioners</strong></em></p>
