7938	Set A 3-Course French Meal For Your Valentine: With Love & Help From EatTreat	<blockquote><p>“I think careful cooking is love, don&#8217;t you? The loveliest thing you can cook for someone who&#8217;s close to you is about as nice a valentine as you can give” – Julia Child</p></blockquote><p>At Eat Treat, we chose to get swept up in all the romanticism, and play cupid from within the confines of our test kitchen! The cuisine of choice was French—if there’s one country that epitomizes romance above all else, it’s definitely France—and so we prepared a simple, albeit elegant spread over three courses. Now don’t go running for the hills just yet; we assure you even the most unskilled cook will be able to recreate this spread at home. All you really need, is a little bit of passion, and a whole lot of love!&nbsp;We say skip the dinner at a fancy-shmancy restaurant, don an apron and go the whole nine yards for such Valentine&#8217;s Day ideas. If you’re still hesitating, just follow our step-by-step guide to a fabulous meal that says those three magic words with so much more intention!</p><h4><strong>To Sip – Red Wine&nbsp;</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280.jpg"><img title = "Set A 3-Course French Meal For Your Valentine: With Love &amp; Help From EatTreat  "class="wp-image-7988 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280.jpg" alt = "romantic Recipes French cooking Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wine-bottle-1209934_1280-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><p>Not only does <a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/alcohol-chocolate-pairings-dinner-party/">red wine pair perfectly </a>with lamb meat, it also holds a depth that’s incomparable to any other alcohol.
