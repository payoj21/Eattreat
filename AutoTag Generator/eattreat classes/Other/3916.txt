Lodi is a popular haunt for leisurely dinners, evening cocktails and other gastronomical experiences. The restaurant is an extension of Lodi Garden itself and is surrounded by greenery and trees—some of which are more than a 100 years old. The menu has dishes adapted from various cuisines, but the emphasis is majorly on the much favoured European influenced cuisine. And we particularly love this one because we hosted our own Launch here and the staff was absolutely fabulous.</p><p>For bookings, contact: +91 981 874 3232<br />Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sewara.LodiTheGardenRestaurant/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Lodi &#8211; The Garden Restaurant</strong></em></p>
