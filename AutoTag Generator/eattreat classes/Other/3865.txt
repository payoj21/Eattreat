3865	Designer Sabyasachi’s New Dinnerware For Pottery Barn Is Exquisitely Vintage	<p>When it comes to bridal-wear and drapes, Sabyasachi is a name to behold. But this time, his collaboration with American lifestyle chain Pottery Barn, is giving us #DinnerGoals (Is that a thing? Well, now it is). The home products line just keeps on giving with their dinner plates, jewellery boxes, home linen, decorative and table tops.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>The art has been created by the artists of the Sabyasachi Art Foundation and they have outdone themselves with the pretty florals, dazzling tones and a old-world charm. This is Sabyasachi’s first move into the home furnishings vertical that has given way to 50 different pieces of textiles and ornaments.</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMO9KdGiTl0?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>If you’re in the market for brocaded throw pillows, tufted rugs, and luxurious quilts, the capsule collection is available online on Pottery Barn. The prices range from $14.50 – $1,799, but obviously, it&#8217;s all worth it. They will also be soon available in stores 1st Nov onwards.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What To Look Out For</strong></p><p>The goal of the collection is to inspire people to travel, according to the designer. He also said, “My goal with this collaboration was to bring exotic whimsy and colour into American homes.” We are absolutely loving the Animal Salad Plates, and the glass cut bottles in Mughal colours are blowing our collective minds.</p><p><i>Photo Courtesy Of: <a href="http://www.potterybarn.com/shop/new/sabyasachi-collection/" target="_blank">Pottery Barn</a></i></p>
