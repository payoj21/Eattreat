8412	This Boutique Makes Bouquets Of Fruits & Wine Instead Of Regular Boring Flowers!	<p>Missing your significant other or you really messed up? A bouquet is always a good idea. But a regular flower bouquet doesn&#8217;t really cut it anymore does it. We happen-chanced over this quirky little boutique called Phalahaar that makes fruit bouquets! And not just any fruits. Doing some amazingly wonderful Ikebana-esque decorations with pears, apples and other seasonal fruits, this place has all of our votes, when it comes to keeping your loved one happy… and healthy!</p><h4><strong>What Do They Bring To The Table?</strong></h4><p>Bouquets, of course! With intricate and detailed placement of large oriental lilies and kiwis, we were truly in awe of the care and effort they take to deliver a really well-constructed gift. The flowers are beautiful and large and the bouquets easily stay perfect upto a week, before the old flowers give way to the buds blossoming.&nbsp;</p><p>You can keep plucking the gorgeous fruits out of this present for the next few weeks, because the number of fruits that come are truly a lot. We counted upto 6 kiwis, 6 apples, numerous pears, some oranges and beautiful Australian grapes that have a super long shelf life.&nbsp;</p><p>The fruit basket is also a great addition in the kitchen and we’d definitely recommend you recycle all of the decorations, even after the flowers wilt. Phalahaar will customise all of your bouquet request and also make sure you get exactly what you asked for.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Comes-To-1.png"><img title = "This Boutique Makes Bouquets Of Fruits &amp; Wine Instead Of Regular Boring Flowers!

Just give them a ring and you&#8217;ll get an idea of what they can create for you.</p><p>While we believed initially that they were a little on the pricey side, but once we saw the ginormous bouquet of fruits that was finally delivered, we can definitely say that the whole business is absolutely worth it. The quality of fruits, flowers and props used are distinctively superior and we loved that the thing stays put for days on end.
