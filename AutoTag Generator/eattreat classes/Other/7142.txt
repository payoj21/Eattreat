7142	Get Meals For As Low As 10 Rupees At Aam Aadmi Canteens In Delhi!	<p>The Aam Aadmi Party, in its new initiative, has set up an Aam Aadmi Canteen at LNJP Hospital where you can get food for only INR 10!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>In its new initiative to make affordable meals available at the lowest possible rates, the Aam Aadmi Party has launched its first subsidised canteen and LNJP Hospital (Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital) after much delay. One can have full meals at the hospital canteen for only Rs. 10Â and is open for the staff, attendants, and visitors. This is in line with the highly subsidised Amma Canteens in Tamil Nadu.</p><p>The canteen will run on a trial basis for a month, during which they&#8217;ll only be serving lunch. After the one month period is over, they&#8217;re going to include dinner, and later, breakfast. The Delhi Health Minister said that the trial doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s going to shut down after a month, it only means that they plan to keep it up and running. He even took to twitter with photographs of the inauguration and dined at the canteen.</p><p>The Director of the hospital says that it&#8217;s a welcome move considering how many of the staff members, including the doctors and junior doctors, used to manage with street food that is unhygienic, more often than not.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s For Lunch?</strong></h4><p>They&#8217;ll be serving a set vegetarian meal with simple and nutritious items. Each portion includes two rotis, a vegetable dish (that&#8217;ll change according to the menu of the day), rice, and dal or curry, or Chholey (chickpeas).</p><p>To make food service easier and efficient, they&#8217;re going to introduce tokens that you can buy from the separate token counter that they&#8217;ve setup.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Delays Leading To The Launch</strong></h4><p>The Aam Aadmi Canteen took a long time to come up, since the announcement was first made back in July 2015 when they&#8217;d said that the first couple of canteens will be up and running within 2 months time.</p><p>Additionally, Delhi government had also released INR 10 crore for setting up these &#8216;Aam Aadmi Canteens&#8217; across the city where people could buy subsidised food. Cm Manish Sisodia said that it has been proposed for these canteens to be set up in the city where the poor, downtrodden, daily wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, and construction workers can go to buy a hot, hygienic meal at subsidised prices. The functioning of these canteens will be monitored by the &#8216;Bureau Of Affordable Meals.&#8217;</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hungryforever.com/delhi-gets-first-aam-aadmi-canteen-lnjp-hospital/amp/">here</a>.</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
