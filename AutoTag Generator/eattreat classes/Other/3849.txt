While the Indian version might include tandoori food, the signature American barbeque with basted ribs is not to be missed!</p><p>While the food will definitely set a high bar, the curators are just as enthusiastic about Jazz and Blues-tone of entertainment. Bringing the culture of these countries along with their food; music, dance, art and tourism will also be a part of the festival.</p><p>This is going to happen on 9 &#8211; 11th December.
