But this time, it’s different, as reported by <em>The Hindu</em>. They have been allowed to celebrate inside the high walls but without any fire or fireworks.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First </strong></h4><p>The inmates have been allowed to decorate their sleeping areas in the way they want and will be getting some amazing food during this time. Jail authorities have planned celebrations which will include food stalls, entertainment and meet-ups with film actors. The festivities will continue over 10 days and the premises will be done up.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What’s More?</strong></h4><p>Going to be more of a mela, authorities have ensured the best possible meals and over the next week, each jail inside the premises will get an evening to celebrate the festival.
