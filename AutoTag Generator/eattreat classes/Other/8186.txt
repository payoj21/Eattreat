8186	Eat Arty Continental Food & Enjoy Them French Windows At 52 Janpath	<p>Ambica Gulati takes us on a journey of 52 Janpath in Delhi, which happens to be one of those&nbsp;unique theme restaurants in Delhi<a class="m_6034689961447443235gmail-spGb-f">&nbsp;that have got it all&#8230; just right.&nbsp;</a></p><hr><p>With a discernible influence of Victorian interiors, 52 Janpath offers some delectable cuisine. I didnâ€™t check the entire menu because I was busy looking at the high sofas, a relaxing library corner, firewall, wine cellar, cigar and whisky shelves. This restaurant offers different cuisines such as American, Italian, Thai, European. And the food is freshly cooked with lots of greens and a has good sizeable portions. The drinks are equally innovative and one would like to sit around with friends and family here.</p><h4><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n.jpg"><img title = "Eat Arty Continental Food &amp; Enjoy Them French Windows At 52 Janpath  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8226" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n.jpg" alt = "themed restaurants janpath continental Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14681873_1795945884012451_4039354623209717531_n-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The presentation is good as is the fact that you find a bottle on every table. With the wine culture gaining pace in India, this is among the new initiatives that I see in restaurants.&nbsp; The restaurant also has an outdoors area where you can smoke or sit around in cooler weather. The choice of cocktails is good. And there are an array of appetizers.</p><p>What I would recommend: <strong>Irish Potato Skins</strong>,<strong> Duo of Chargrilled Chicken</strong>,<strong> Celtic Caesar salad</strong>, <strong>Prawns Scotch Eggs</strong>, <strong>Pizza 52</strong>, <strong>Tiramisu</strong>.</p><p>Even though, the <strong>coffee sangria</strong> came recommended, I thought it was too fruity and the coffee flavour was less. But the ending with a<em>&nbsp;paan</em>&nbsp;shot was a much-needed cleanser, after the huge tasting session.</p><p><em>This article first appeared on <a href="https://atravellerswishlist.com/2016/07/17/eating-arty-food-at-52-janpath-delhi/" target="_blank"><strong>A Traveller&#8217;s Wishlist</strong></a> by <strong>Ambica Gulati</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:<strong> 52 Janpath</strong></em></p>
