7912	There’s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre & Now The Hills Are Calling Us	<p>We recently made our way over to Bikaner House to check out the Jammu and Ladakh Food Festival at Chor Bizarre and we have to say, we were quite impressed.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Chor Bizarre is a newly opened restaurant by the people who own Hotel Broadway in Daryaganj, at Bikaner House and serves Kashmiri food. The entire place is decorated with artefacts from all the Chor Bazaars of India.<br />Chor Bizarre is easy to locate, but do not go by their Facebook page or Google maps, unless you want to land in the middle of Old Delhi—something we had to learn the hard way. The restaurant doesn’t serve alcohol, but does serve some interesting mocktails, which you’re going to read more about. They’re open for lunch and dinner, and close for a few hours between the meal times before they commence operations for the evening.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>There’s no one perfect spot to sit at here, you can choose wherever you want to be seated, depending on how many people you’re going to be accompanied by. But, if you like vintage tribal jewellery, you might want to sit at this one table by the bar that has a glass top and has neatly laid out metal jewellery laid out for anyone to see.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha.jpg"><img title = "There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7919" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kaladi-Kulcha-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We had the good fortune of being able to get a few things from both the regions—Ladakh and Jammu. The chef started us off with a hot bowl of <strong>Gyathuk</strong>, the Ladakhi flat noodle soup, which was nice and meaty, and just what we needed after our little adventure before we finally reached Bikaner House. Next, we got the <strong>Kaladi Kulcha</strong> from the Dogri menu (Jammu) which was made with a special type of homemade cheese, and was just the most delicious snack to have.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok.jpg"><img title = "There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7922" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ti-mok-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>For mains from the Ladakhi menu, we got <strong>Ti-mok</strong> of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian kinds, which came with tiny little <strong>Tingmo</strong> bread. The curry itself was nice and flavourful and the Tingmo was a nice accompaniment for them. We also got the <strong>Ladakhi Pulao</strong> which is generously topped with caramelised carrots and onions, and the<strong> Chu-tagir</strong>, which is a delicious and flavourful stew made of lamb, dumplings made of whole wheat flour, potatoes, peas, and spinach.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri.jpg"><img title = "There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7920" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dogri-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The chef also sent in some of the Dogri specialities which included the <strong>Khatta Meat</strong> that is served with a <strong>Khameeri Roti</strong>. The meat was so soft and well cooked, it fell apart when we first took a bite out of it, and the Khameeri Roti, made with yoghurt and refined flour, looked a lot like a bhatura and was just as soft. They also sent us bowls of <strong>Khatte Rajma</strong> which had this slight tang to it, and <strong>Maa Ki Dal Ka Madra</strong>, which was Dal Makhani cooked in yoghurt and topped with lots of raisins and fried slivers of almonds.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot.jpg"><img title = "There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7921" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dessert-apricot-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>To end it on a sweet note, the chef sent us a small bowl of <strong>Sun Dried Apricot Stewed in Apricot Syrup</strong> with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This dessert came in from the Ladakhi menu.&nbsp;If you’ve wanted a dessert that’s not too high on the sugar factor, this is it. The dried apricots and the ice cream went very well together, and we don’t think we want to have plain old vanilla ice cream the usual way ever again. They also sent <strong>Meetha Chawal</strong>, a Dogri speciality. It was so well made, each grain of rice was separate. This was topped with raisins and fried slivers of nuts, and was flavoured with a little cardamom. It was a nice end to a perfect meal.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>Since they don’t serve alcohol, we got a couple of their mocktails. The <strong>Adraki Punch</strong> was nice and spicy and the <strong>Imli Mirchi Mary</strong> was, well, interesting to say the least. If you really like your Bloody Mary, you might want to try this one out. We also got a glass of their fresh <strong>Watermelon Juice</strong> which was nice and refreshing.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi.jpg"><img title = "There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  There&#039;s A Ladakh Food Festival Happening At Chor Bizarre &amp; Now The Hills Are Calling Us  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7923" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   sweet savoury north Indian kashmiri Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/momo-ladakhi-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>While everything was delicious, at some points of time we felt that the meat dishes tasted a little similar. Also, they’d sent in <strong>Kachalu Chaat</strong> (yam) and we’d expected it to be warm and soft, but it was the opposite, probably because it’s a vegetable. The drinks, too, weren’t as cold as we’d expected them to be. The <strong>momos</strong> on the Ladakhi menu weren&#8217;t anything special. But these are just minor discrepancies, and our overall experience was wonderful.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>So what we’re saying is that you absolutely must head to Chor Bizarre to try all the delicious food on their menu. This food festival that ran for a very brief time gave us a taste of the specialties of surrounding areas.The menu was specially designed by members of the royal family of Ladakh. Their usual menu has Kashmiri food which is beyond amazing.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Bikaner House, Pandara Road, India Gate</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 9910601574</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chorbizarre/" target="_blank">Chor Bizarre</a></p>
