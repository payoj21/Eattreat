As the Art Partners of the Palate Fest, they’re offering temporary opportunities to artists to engage with the public. They’re bringing three art groups to the fest&#8211; Art Buzz, Global Nomadic Art Project / India, and Young Arts For All (YAFA).</p><p>Arts4All is also presenting free nature workshops on both days for children of all ages with Day 1 being about Nature Sketching&nbsp;and an installation with found objects on Day 2.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Art Buzz</strong></h4><p>Art Buzz is an art gallery that’s being put up amidst trees, with about a dozen young practising artists showcasing their works. The combination of art and nature will not only have an assortment of artworks&nbsp;but also will have the participating artists sketching and painting while interacting with visitors about their various art practices. The gallery at Art Buzz is going to be curated by Megha Madan.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Global Nomadic Art Project (GNAP) / India</strong></h4><p>The exhibition at the Palate Fest would include photographs by some extremely talented national and international artists, as well as some installations by nature artists based on the nature art theme. They’re going to showcase works by Unnati Singh, Somu Desai, Gunjan Tyagi, and Aarti Zaveri.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>YAFA</strong></h4><p>Young Arts For All, or YAFA, is a specially designed project for young artists who are still in school. It is a perfect platform for encouraging young artists who will be able to share and interact with their viewers first hand, and at this large a scale. They’re featuring 13-year-old Anya Goel of Step By Step School, who has been experimenting with clay for the past four years. At the moment, she’s exploring Delhi monuments through her works.</p><p>Also being featured by YAFA is 15-year-old Devina Bahri of Mayo College, Ajmer. She has a keen interest in photography and has been travelling with her artist mother for exhibitions and art camps, and in the process, is honing her skills, and creating her own stories through photography.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What’s More? A Book Fair!</strong></h4><p>There&#8217;s also going to be a book fair by Om Books at the Imagine Fest, and so you can stock up on all the cookbooks you need to whip up your version of art. You can get your own signed copies of &nbsp;<strong>Welcome On Board</strong> by Vinamra Longani, which is about the exciting adventures of an international flight attendant, <strong>The Vishnu Chronicles- The Hunt for Rama’s Bow (Adventure I)</strong> by Suhail Mathur, the bestselling author of the historical fiction The Bhairav Putras,&nbsp;<strong>Upon A Bright Red Bench</strong> by Pallavi Rebbapragada, and <strong>Dilli Leaks</strong> by Srishti Khanna, which is a witty, humorous, non-judgemental yet sardonic take on Delhi as the power hub of the country, with its multi-layered underbelly.</p><p>Day 1 of the Imagine Fest will also see a number of<strong> talks</strong> around food and art going on including&nbsp;&#8220;Bread, Butter &amp; Books &#8211; Food in South Asian Writing&#8221; presented by The DSC Prize for South Asian Literature.
