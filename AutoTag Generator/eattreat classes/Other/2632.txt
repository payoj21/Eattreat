2632	Food Trends That Have Ruled Delhi In 2016	<p>We’re about halfway through this year, and we’ve seen a lot of trends come and go these past few months. Here’s our list of top trends that have ruled Delhi in 2016.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Healthy Eating</strong></h4><p>The health food scene is booming. The average Delhiite seems to want to reconsider that burger or a slice of cake for healthier options. And so, every few months, we see new brands introducing fresh and healthy flavours of cold pressed juices, salads and nut milk. You can treat yourself to some of these guilt-free goodies at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rawking.in/" target="_blank">RawKing </a>(for cold pressed juices), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saladdays.co/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Salad Days</a>, and <a href="http://www.allnut.in/" target="_blank">AllNut </a>(for delicious cold pressed almond milk).</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bread-1544574_1920.jpg"><img title = "Food Trends That Have Ruled Delhi In 2016  "class="size-full wp-image-2667 aligncenter" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bread-1544574_1920.jpg" alt = "  " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bread-1544574_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bread-1544574_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bread-1544574_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Regional Indian Cuisine</strong></h4><p>A want to experiment with the many flavours that regional Indian cuisine has to offer is quite noticeable on menus these days. Chefs have been including Indian flavours, and there has been a marked increase in the number of restaurants that serve more than just North Indian and Mughlai cuisine. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rosang/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Rosang Café</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CafeLota/" target="_blank">Café Lota</a> are just a few of the many restaurants that cater to our ever changing taste-buds.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dining In &amp; Gourmet Catering</strong></h4><p>Organising parties, and celebrating every occasion is quintessentially Delhi for you, and there are some very cool joints that take the words ‘catering to your every need’ a little too seriously. If you’re hosting a party or a get-together, the good folks at <a href="http://www.holybelly.in/" target="_blank">HolyBelly</a> and <a href="http://www.harrysgourmetcatering.com/" target="_blank">Harry’s Gourmet Catering</a> are who you should get in touch with!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Theme Restaurants</strong></h4><p>One of our favourite trends that have carried over from last year is theme based restaurants. We see new outlets in the city opening almost every month, with a dominant cuisine that extends to the décor. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zutischbistro/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Zu Tisch</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnpluggedCourtyard/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Unplugged Courtyard</a> are some of the better-known restaurants in this regard.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
