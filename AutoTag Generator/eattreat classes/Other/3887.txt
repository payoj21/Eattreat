3887	Flu Season Is Here & Here Are Some Home Remedies For You	<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every couple of months, we fall prey to a host of infections in the air and invariably end up on strong antibiotics to battle our way back to health. The next time you’re dealing with a fever, a sore throat, a cold that makes you wish you’d never been born and a cough that makes it impossible for you to get your beauty sleep, skip making a visit to the doc in favour of these natural remedies instead.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>For A Cold</strong></h4><p>There’s nothing worse than the common cold. It drains you of all your energy and leaves you feeling like something the cat dragged home. The next time you’re afflicted with a runny nose, garlic is your go-to guy. Take a clove or two of fresh, raw garlic and crush it or cut it into thin slivers—if you have the stomach, just chomp down on a clove—garlic produces a powerful antibacterial shortly after it is crushed, and before it is cooked or heated.</p><p>Eat it in this state and you’ll immediately feel the respite as it works its magic. We recommend eating a crushed clove every four hours until your cold subsides.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>For A Cough</strong></h4><p>Place half an onion in a jar, and submerge it in about six-eight tablespoons of honey. Let this mixture rest for about six hours. Have one tablespoon thrice a day and watch that cough disappear. It sounds worse than it really is, and you’ll feel the difference on the very first day.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>For A Congested Chest</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/drops-1715832_1920.jpg"><img title = "Flu Season Is Here &amp; Here Are Some Home Remedies For You  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3889" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/drops-1715832_1920.jpg" alt = "sick remedies illness Easy   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/drops-1715832_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/drops-1715832_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/drops-1715832_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>This is one home remedy we can swear by and it works like a charm every single time! Add a dash (about a cap full) of eucalyptus oil to a boiling pot of water (just turn off the flame and do it right over the stove), cover your head with a large towel and hold it over the steaming pot and inhale the wafts of steam for as long as you can bear it. The anti-bacterial properties in eucalyptus will instantly clear up the congestion in your chest and you’ll be able to see a marked difference in your breathing after just one sitting.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>EatExtra</strong></h4><p>Other than these tried-and-tested methods, here are a few pointers you should keep in mind when you’re feeling under the weather. Keeping your system hydrated is the best thing you can do; drink at least four litres of water in a day.</p><p>A teaspoon of honey with cinnamon powder in the mornings tastes great and is a good way to keep the flu at bay. Apple cider vinegar might be better known for its weight-loosing benefits, but it’s also a wonder ingredient for keeping healthy. When the flu is in the air, drink a glass of warm water with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, and alternatively gargle with the same concoction – you’ll sail through flu season without a hitch!</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
