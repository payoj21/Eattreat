With a long blade (usually around six-ten inches) and wide surface, this is best used for daily chores like chopping, mincing, dicing and slicing. Trust us, this go-to blade truly lives up to its name. Let’s not forget, there’s no chef without a chef’s knife!</p><h4><strong>Paring Knife</strong></h4><p>A baby version of the chef’s knife, this small blade should be used for peeling vegetables and fruits, and slicing small garnishes (like parsley). Given its small size, it’s also perfect for more intricate jobs like deveining a shrimp!</p><h4><strong>Serrated Utility Knife</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920.jpg"><img title = "Know Your Knives: Your Guide To Every Kind Of Knife In The Kitchen  Know Your Knives: Your Guide To Every Kind Of Knife In The Kitchen  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8274" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920.jpg" alt = "meat Kitchen cutlery chef Category:Meats   meat Kitchen cutlery chef Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bread-933228_1920-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:&nbsp;<strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><p>As the name suggests, this one’s the father of all bread knives, and is just the thing you need to cut a loaf into perfectly uniform slices. What you didn’t know, is that it also comes in handy for slicing through vegetables and fruits with a stubborn skin. The serrated edge cuts clean through the skin, ensuring it doesn’t tear while you’re still at the job. Tomatoes are a perfect example; try it the next time you’re making homemade pasta sauce—you’re welcome!&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Boning Knife&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>As the name suggests, this blade is best used for separating meat from the bone. It’s got a good grip, and the narrow, sharp edge allows you the ultimate precision in cut. Try deboning a chicken to test its prowess; we promise you’ll get the job done!</p><h4><strong>Fish Knife&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>The perfect partner to the boning knife (they just look so well matched!), this one is the most bendable knife of all, and is a godsend when you’re trying to fillet a fish. Additionally, use it to remove the excess fat from cuts of meat.</p><p><strong>Meat Cleaver</strong></p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver.jpg"><img title = "Know Your Knives: Your Guide To Every Kind Of Knife In The Kitchen  Know Your Knives: Your Guide To Every Kind Of Knife In The Kitchen  Know Your Knives: Your Guide To Every Kind Of Knife In The Kitchen  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8275" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver.jpg" alt = "meat Kitchen cutlery chef Category:Meats   meat Kitchen cutlery chef Category:Meats   meat Kitchen cutlery chef Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cleaver-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:&nbsp;<strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><p>Aside from a stellar performance in most horror movies, the meat cleaver is a real star when it comes to chopping through meat. The sharp and heavy blade ensures a direct, clean cut right through the bone, while the design of the handle provides a strong grip (you don’t want this one flying out of your hands!). As a bonus, this kitchen heavyweight is just the thing you need to bust open a lobster!</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
