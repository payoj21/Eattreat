3670	Global Hunger Index Is Out, And Unfortunately India Is Towards The Bottom	<p>It is no surprise that with the growth in population and the increase in the number of houses being built on land that can be used for cultivation, India is almost at the bottom of the list. Which means, that there are more people in India who go hungry each day, or are underfed.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>An analysis of world hunger levels has ranked India 97 among 118 countries. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has placed the country behind Bangladesh, Rwanda, and Nigeria on the scale. They had collaborated with humanitarian agencies and measured the hunger problem using indicators such as the proportion of population undernourished, levels of stunting, and wasting among children under five to generate the report.</p><p>India has only improved slightly on these indicators since 2008—the last time the Global Hunger Index was brought out. The slow pace of improvement suggests that India, among other countries, will not be able to meet UN’s goal of ending world hunger by 2030.</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161012/jsp/frontpage/story_113034.jsp#.V_9dppN97IF" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p><p><em>Representative Photo Courtesy </em>Of:<strong><em> Pixabay</em></strong></p>
