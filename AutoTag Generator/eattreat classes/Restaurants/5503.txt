5503	Curtain Call: 6 Newly Opened Delhi Restaurants That Wowed Us In 2016	<p>2016 is coming to a close. While many of us would be more than happy to bid this year adieu, we do have to concede that as far as Delhi’s gastronomy scene is concerned, we’ve seen a lot of dynamic entrants who have switched up the game like never before. We thought it would be appropriate to draw the curtains on 2016, with a list to laud and celebrate the Delhi restaurants taking the dining out experience to the next level.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fatty Bao</strong></h4><p>Trendy, chic and fun! It’s new Asian dining, and an inventive bar experience. From the house of Olive Bar &amp; Kitchen, Fatty Bao does well-crafted drinks and inventive Asian food served in an edgy, chic atmosphere. This place is a sure winner in terms of ambience, food and drink! The <strong>Char Grilled Chicken Skewers</strong> here are a must-try.</p><p>Follow them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thefattybaodel/">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Masala Library by Jiggs Kalra</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13962515_304379143255220_1124971375646468202_n.jpg"><img title = "Curtain Call: 6 Newly Opened Delhi Restaurants That Wowed Us In 2016  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5413" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13962515_304379143255220_1124971375646468202_n.jpg" alt = "restaurants new in town new delhi khan market delhi Chanakyapuri New Delhi Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13962515_304379143255220_1124971375646468202_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13962515_304379143255220_1124971375646468202_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13962515_304379143255220_1124971375646468202_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>What’s an end-of-2016 Delhi restaurants list without a <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//masala-library-jiggs-kalra-molecular/">mention of Masala Library</a>? This culinary spectacle opened its doors to us early in 2016, and wowed the unsuspecting public with one gastronomical marvel after another. With an ambience that simply conjures up the word ‘grandeur’ in the mind, and a carefully prepared 19-course (Yes!) Tasting Menu with signature creations that captivate (<strong>Deconstructed Samosa</strong>, <strong>Curry leaf Prawns</strong> and <strong>Naga pork with black beans and bamboo shoots</strong> to name a few), Masala Library by Jiggs Kalra has taken Delhi by storm.</p><p>Follow Masala Library <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MasalaLibraryDelhi/?fref=ts">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ping’s Cafe Orient</strong></h4><p>From the house of PCO and ATM, Ping’s Café Orient debuted in Delhi this year at Lodhi Colony, serving Asian and fusion fare, along with a heady cocktail list. We loved their Asian Street Food, and also that they have low-cal healthy options too. We loved their <strong>Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dumplings</strong>, <strong>Smoked Bacon Wrapped Prawns</strong> and <strong>Red Curry with Chicken</strong>. For drinks, our pick was <strong>Mood Cocktail (Mango)</strong>.</p><p>Follow them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pingsbypco/">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Burma Burma</strong></h4><p>Burma Burma entered the Delhi restaurants scene this year, exposing Delhi to heady flavours of Burmese cuisine. We loved the concept, design and layout – besides the food! Don’t let the fact that they’re an all-vegetarian restaurant fool you into being apprehensive. Vegetarian Asian fare? You might think. But you’d be surprised at the flavour driven menu at Burma Burma. From the <strong>Chickpea Tohu</strong>, to <strong>Samuza Hincho</strong>, or the <strong>Raw Mango Salad</strong> and <strong>Burma Burma Oh No Khow Suey</strong> – all these dishes left us spellbound and asking for more.</p><p>Follow them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BurmaBurmaIndia/">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Parallel</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey.jpg"><img title = "Curtain Call: 6 Newly Opened Delhi Restaurants That Wowed Us In 2016  Curtain Call: 6 Newly Opened Delhi Restaurants That Wowed Us In 2016  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4363" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey.jpg" alt = "restaurants new in town new delhi khan market delhi Chanakyapuri New Delhi Category:Restaurants asian   restaurants new in town new delhi khan market delhi Chanakyapuri New Delhi Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>A craft kitchen and bar, tucked away in the middle lanes of Delhi’s ever-popular Khan Market, Parallel has wowed many with their <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//gourmet-breakfast-donuts-parallel/">experimental food </a>and fusion fare. We loved downing our beer with the <strong>Kasundi Chicken Pav</strong>, and <strong>Paunchy Pig</strong> – which is basically a thepla-wrapped pulled pork.

When here, you can expect an extensive menu of Mangalore-Bangalore seafood fare, completely unpretentious and flavorful. Our picks would be the Seafood Platter, which has a bit of fish, prawn and crab as well, and <strong>Chicken Ghee Roast</strong>.</p><p>Follow them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SanadigeDelhi/">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
