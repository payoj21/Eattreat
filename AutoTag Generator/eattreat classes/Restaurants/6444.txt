6444	So Your Goa Plans Fell Through? Head To Lady Baga For A Taste Of The Beach Life!	<p>You’ve probably made endless plans to go to Goa with friends. WhatsApp groups have been made and abandoned way too many times for you to count. Or maybe, you miss the crazy time you spent at the last holiday you went on there. AD Singh is launching his new restaurant ‘Lady Baga’ by mid-January. It has all the Goa feels and is going to be the only place that serves Goan food in Delhi.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Vodka-shots-Lady-Baga.jpg"><img title = "So Your Goa Plans Fell Through?

There are projections of waves on the walls to make it look exactly like you’re dining at the beach. The sand on the floor, the hammocks, tie-dye cushions, bead curtains, sun beds, retro artwork on the walls—all complete the look of the hippie culture of the region.</p><p>Look out for crazy cocktails like the <a href="http://eattreat.in/goan-cuisine-in-delhi-lady-baga/" target="_blank"><strong>Goan Chorizo infused Bloody Mary</strong></a> and <strong>vodka shots </strong>flavoured with <strong>coconut</strong> and <strong>palm</strong> since you&#8217;re not legally allowed to get feni across Goa&#8217;s border. They’re focussing on serving Goan food in Delhi, and have items like the <strong>Goan Chorizo Pulav</strong> and the <strong>Pork Vindaloo</strong>. But, they also have oddities on their menu from other cultures—because the beach shack doesn’t necessarily serve one particular cuisine, it has food that comforts the soul.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Lady-Baga.jpg"><img title = "So Your Goa Plans Fell Through?

We also hear that they plan to open more of these restaurants across the country.</p><p>Lady Baga is opening at the place that Monkey Bar once used to be. They’re opening doors on Wednesday, the 11th of January at noon.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> P-3/90, Connaught Circus, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 081306 56644</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ladybagaindia/?hc_ref=SEARCH&amp;fref=nf" target="_blank">Lady Baga</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of:</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joyjeetm" target="_blank"><strong><em>Joy Jeet Mukherjee</em></strong></a></p>
