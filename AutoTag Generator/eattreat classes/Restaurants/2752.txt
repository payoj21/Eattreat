2752	Boom Food Brings You BBQ Pork Ribs & Kimchi Rice At Work & Home	<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>We had the evergreen joy of sampling the secrets of yet another Pan Asian food delivery this week.&nbsp;And this time, we shook hands with Boom Food.&nbsp;They’re a delivery-and-catering-only service, with their office located in the nifty lanes of Shahpur Jat. All in all, a vast variety of pan-Asian and Indian cuisine is promised on the menu!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cherry Picked</strong></h4><p>The food comes in excellent packaging, which makes it easy to eat at a desk or heat in the office microwave. The dips and sauces as well as the curries are so tightly packed that it may take you a while to divest the food of the tapes (which in our opinion is a good thing).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>From a variety of Korean, Thai and North-Indian dishes, we had our clear winners. Order the Spinach, Corn and Cheese&nbsp;Dumplings&nbsp;before you even open the menu; vegetarian or not, you’re in for a surprise. Soft, melt-in-mouth and perfectly balanced proportions of spinach, corn and cheese, the dish plays its part of the appetiser that leaves you wanting for more.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spinach-corn-dimsum.jpg"><img title = "Boom Food Brings You BBQ Pork Ribs &amp; Kimchi Rice At Work &amp; Home  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2763" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spinach-corn-dimsum.jpg" alt = "meats delivery Chinese Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spinach-corn-dimsum.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spinach-corn-dimsum-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spinach-corn-dimsum-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We moved on to the Star Anise Chicken, <b>&nbsp;</b>a tiny side-step from the North-Indian chilli chicken,&nbsp;which made itself count. You can’t quite put a finger on what works—it’s got the usual sauté of capsicum-onion duo—but it’s not a flavour you’re used to. The&nbsp;Thai Vegetable Green Curry<b>&nbsp;</b>nailed the traditional blend of lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime to remind you, with every dig, why you love the signature dish in the first place.</p><p>The rice was warm and fresh and stood out.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>What didn’t sit so well?&nbsp;Home-made Flat Noodles With Black Pepper Sauce&nbsp;was&nbsp;a tad more salty than necessary.<br />Although, the texture of the flat noodles was great on the tongue. The Boom Chicken was a bit spicy for us, though if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re into, then we&#8217;d recommend it fersher.</p><p>The&nbsp;Asian BBQ Pork Ribs&nbsp;had a lot of takers for this, but the collective ruling was ‘more fat than flavour’.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Boom Food’s here, and it’s letting us know. While we had our winners and tanks, we raise a collective thumbs-up to the outlet. Hit them up and courageously try:</p><p>Korean Pork Bulgogi, Japanese Style Braised Pork Belly, Malaysian Rendang Curry, Thai Basil Minced Chicken (Krapow), Stir Fried Prawns With Bird&#8217;s Eye Chilli, Nasi Goreng, Sautéed Haricot Beans With Caramelised Coconut, Oriental Baby Aubergine With Sweet Spices and the Roast lamb Slices With Chilli. (Personally suggested by their team, we’re sure you’re in for a stack of pleasant surprises.)</p><p>Open from 12:00 pm to 10:30 pm, Boom Food accepts bulk orders.
