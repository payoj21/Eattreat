6714	We Tried The Goan Chorizo-Infused Bloody Mary At Lady Baga & It Was SO GOOD!	<p>If you’re that person who’s made a million WhatsApp groups for that trip to Goa but nothing’s ever materialised, you have our sympathies. But now, you can get a taste of the shack life right here in Delhi! AD Singh of the Olive Group has opened a very colourful, very ‘hep’ restaurant that serves hearty,<a href="http://eattreat.in/goan-food-delhi-lady-baga/"> fun Goan cuisine in Delhi</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Lady Baga is a Goan shack-themed restaurant built over two levels serving Goan cuisine in Delhi. It’s located where Monkey Bar once used to be in CP. They’ve got a three-sided bar, projections of waves on the walls, and sand to make it feel like you’re actually at the beach. Brocade blouses adorn the wall near the bar, and they&#8217;ve made a water curtain that makes you feel like you&#8217;re at the beach and listening to waves crashing against the shore, if you happen to be seated near it. The entire vibe of the restaurant is very friendly and the peppy music is loud, but it just makes you feel right at home. It is certainly one of the few happier places we’ve been to in the city.</p><p>The seating arrangement ranges from hammocks to sunbeds, cane chairs, and wooden deck chairs. The entire restaurant is covered in retro colours and pop-art styled artwork. You can see origami stars and fairy lights suspended from the ceiling in the lower level, and there&#8217;s a place for hookah/sheesha upstairs, apart from an outdoor seating arrangement.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>The best place to sit here is in the outdoor area where it’s a lot quieter. You can see parts of Connaught Place from here while actually being able to hear people when you’re trying to have a conversation. But, if that’s not really your concern, sit at the lower level at the area where they’ve put wooden deck chairs closest to the bar so you can see the projections on the walls while getting high on the many cocktails they have on their menu.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/prawn-lonche.jpg"><img title = "We Tried The Goan Chorizo-Infused Bloody Mary At Lady Baga &amp; It Was SO GOOD!

You can start with the <strong>Yellow Submarine</strong> (hand-cut fries with a dip of the day) and <strong>When You’ve Got The Munchies</strong> (a platter of papad cones, raw mango pickle, Goa’s famous masala Kaju, and charred Recheado Pineapple) to go with your drinks. Next, get the <strong>Prawn Lonche</strong> and the <strong>All You Need Is Chilli Fry</strong> (Calamari) that comes with a <strong>Cafreal dip</strong>. They’re both SO GOOD.</p><p>Get <strong>Father Lorenzo’s Chorizo with pav bread</strong> if you love yourself some pork. You can just sit with this and finish the entire thing by yourself while having that delicious Chorizo. Ask your server for the <strong>Pie Chart</strong>, which is a vegetarian pie of the day. The stuffing changes each day and we got the one with cheese, spinach, and mushrooms. The choux pastry is so nice and light, it crumbles as soon as you touch it with your fork.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5280.jpg"><img title = "We Tried The Goan Chorizo-Infused Bloody Mary At Lady Baga &amp; It Was SO GOOD!

We got the mutton one and loved every spoonful of it. The mutton pieces were so well done that they fell apart when we touched them. For dessert, get <strong>Sticky Fingers</strong> and the <strong>Baga Bebinca</strong>&#8211; the classic Goan dessert that anyone who’s ever been to Goa brings back each time.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/baga-bong.jpg"><img title = "We Tried The Goan Chorizo-Infused Bloody Mary At Lady Baga &amp; It Was SO GOOD!

So they’ve put two differently flavoured bottle shaped shot glasses in a big whisky glass topped with ice. One of them is flavoured with jalapenos, while the other is flavoured with Kokum. You can just keep having these but you’re sure to get high very quickly.</p><p>Get <strong>Moonshine &amp; Hooch</strong> if you’re missing Goa’s feni. The mixologist here has developed vodka with Palm and Cashew and they’re both smoother than feni. Next, get <strong>Bloody Marianna</strong>. This chorizo infused Bloody Mary is so amazing, you can never go back to having Bloody Mary the same way. If you love your Scotch whisky and love the flavours of ginger, they’ve put the two in a cocktail called <strong>The Ginger Man</strong>. Our friend who generally avoids cocktails fell in love with this one (yes, it was that good).</p><p>Now, you can’t have completed the Goa experience without having Port wine. Get their Port Wine Sangria called ‘<strong>A Sangria At Every Port</strong>.’ It’s got Goan Port Wine, red wine, grape juice, vodka, Cointreau, apple juice, and spices that are all put together and aged for a considerable amount of time. You’re never going to go anywhere else for Sangria if you have a taste of this.</p><p>Also get the <strong>Baga Bong</strong>, which is a great sundowner. It’s got white rum, dark rum, lime, grapefruit, passionfruit, and Cointreau. We’re pretty sure you can understand how tipsy one can get if you’ve had all of these drinks. But then again, when in Goa do as the Goans!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The music on the lower floor can be a tad too loud, so if you’re trying to have a conversation, you should move upstairs. But that’s not too big a deal because you&#8217;ll definitely enjoy the peppy music here and recognise old favourites—we were greeted by the Macarena!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5272.jpg"><img title = "We Tried The Goan Chorizo-Infused Bloody Mary At Lady Baga &amp; It Was SO GOOD!
