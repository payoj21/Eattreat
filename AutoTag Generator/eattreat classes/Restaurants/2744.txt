2744	Most Expensive Restaurants Across India To Spend Big Bucks On	<p>Behold the most expensive dishes in India and we hope, you cross some off the list this coming year.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Orient Express &#8211; The Taj Palace Hotel</strong></h4><p>The <strong>Beluga Caviar</strong> costs a mere INR 15,000 (for 30gms and served with the traditional sides) at this luxury hotel and each main starts at at least 2,000 bucks. The seafood sections looks gorgeous and are absolutely worth the 3,000 bucks or so that you will spend on it. But whatever said, the spot is absolutely stunning and just right for that special occasion.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;Taj Palace Hotel, Diplomatic Enclave,&nbsp;Chanakyapuri, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;011 26110202</p><p><strong>Pay</strong>&nbsp;INR 8,000 for two people (approx.)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tian &#8211; ITC Maurya</strong></h4><p>Priced at around INR 7,000 for two, they have three trailer menus that you must look out for. Each of those menus cater to vegetarians as well as non-veggies equally. If you think you won’t be struggling to choose between the ratatouille and the prawns, then you should definitely make your way here.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;ITC Maurya, Diplomatic Enclave,&nbsp;Chanakyapuri, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;011 2611 2233</p><p><strong>Pay</strong>&nbsp;INR 7,000 for two people (approx.)</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lobby-2-3x2-1.jpg"><img title = "Most Expensive Restaurants Across India To Spend Big Bucks On  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2759" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lobby-2-3x2-1.jpg" alt = "restaurants luxury fine-dine Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lobby-2-3x2-1.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lobby-2-3x2-1-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lobby-2-3x2-1-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong><a href="https://taj.tajhotels.com/en-in/taj-palace-new-delhi/?_ga=1.22659058.879813467.1473470986" target="_blank">Taj Palace</a></strong></em></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wasabi By Morimoto &#8211; The Taj Mahal Hotel</strong></h4><p>Revelling in the Japanese cuisine, we’d recommend going for the sushi and sashimi (each piece priced at INR 800 or so). They also have an Wasabi Special Assorted Sushi And Sashimi platter for INR 9150. Tastefully done with a burst of flavours, we love the Yellow Tail Carpaccio (INR 3,000). Be ready to shell out about 7,000 bucks if you’re picking this restaurant for that birthday.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;The Taj Mahal Hotel, 1,&nbsp;Mansingh Road, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;011 66566162, 011 66513585</p><p><strong>Pay</strong>&nbsp;INR 6,000 for two people (approx.)&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wasabi By Morimoto &#8211; The Taj Mahal Palace</strong></h4><p>We HAD to list this again because of their tasting menu. Keeping a mix of Amuse Bouche, appetisers and desserts, the Omakase is priced at approximately INR 6750. The Ghost Tenderloin Sukiyaki that comes with Garlic Soy and Mash Potato is also one the most expensive dishes priced at about 5,200 bucks.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;The Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower, Apollo Bunder,&nbsp;Colaba, Mumbai</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;022 66653366</p><p><strong>Pay</strong>&nbsp;INR 12,000 for two people (approx.)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/str4195re.179868_xx.jpg"><img title = "Most Expensive Restaurants Across India To Spend Big Bucks On  Most Expensive Restaurants Across India To Spend Big Bucks On  "class="alignnone wp-image-2760 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/str4195re.179868_xx.jpg" alt = "restaurants luxury fine-dine Category:Restaurants   restaurants luxury fine-dine Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/str4195re.179868_xx.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/str4195re.179868_xx-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/str4195re.179868_xx-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <a href="http://www.stregismumbai.com/yuuka" target="_blank"><strong>St. Regis</strong></a></em></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yuuka &#8211; The St. Regis Mumbai</strong></h4><p>Honestly we’d cough up the money just for the view, but Yuuka is priced at around INR 8,000 for two. Try the Salmon on fire along with the cucumber sake; a friend tells me that they are both winners (as is the rest of the menu).</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;The St. Regis, 462, Senapati Bapat Marg,&nbsp;Lower Parel, Mumbai</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;022 30151995</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 8,000 for two people (approx.)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Masala Kraft &#8211; The Taj Mahal Palace</strong></h4><p>The Sketch III which includes the non-veg menu can be ordered for INR 6,500 and the Wine Paired Menu is obviously a little more pricier at around 7,500 bucks. Perfect spot for the Indian palate, this one makes it to the list because of their excellent Tandoori Pink Salmon.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;The Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower, Apollo Bunder,&nbsp;Colaba, Mumbai</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;022 66653366</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR&nbsp;6,500 for two people (approx.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy: <a href="https://taj.tajhotels.com/en-in/the-taj-mahal-hotel-new-delhi/?_ga=1.178248556.879813467.1473470986" target="_blank"><strong>The Taj Mahal Hotel</strong></a></em></p>
