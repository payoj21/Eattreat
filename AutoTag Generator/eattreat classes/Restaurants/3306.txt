It’s got a set Asian&nbsp;menu, which is a complete package from soup to starter and main course to dessert. It’s perfect for the office-going clan’s quick lunch or &nbsp;meeting. &nbsp;Like a typical Japanese bento box, this one has a little bit of everything and is a complete meal in itself.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>Their tables near the window have a gorgeous view of the city. If you’re dropping in for lunch, you should definitely get hold of these tables. The restaurant has a wooden&nbsp;<i>jaali</i>&nbsp;partition separating the bar and lounge area with the dining. So, you have the best of both worlds complimenting each other with the stunning décor.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0366.jpg"><img title = "Royal China&#039;s Japanese Bento Box Is As Wonderful As That Eagle&#039;s Eye View Of Delhi  Royal China&#039;s Japanese Bento Box Is As Wonderful As That Eagle&#039;s Eye View Of Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3369" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0366.jpg" alt = "nehru place new delhi japanese Category:Restaurants asian   nehru place new delhi japanese Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0366.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0366-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0366-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bento Box includes a non-vegetarian platter with soup, dim-sums, crispy seaweed, chicken in black bean with Hong Kong noodles and mud cake and includes one soft drink on the tap (INR 850). For the vegetarians, it’s the same menu with stir fried vegetables instead of the non veg option (INR 750).</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you &nbsp;want to order any cocktails or mocktails, &nbsp;you&#8217;ll need to order from the Royal China menu (not the same as the Bento Box set menu), though it is a bit of a disappointment. However, their juices are super refreshing and delicious.</span></p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/royalchinadelhi/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Shreya Ahuja</strong></em></p>
