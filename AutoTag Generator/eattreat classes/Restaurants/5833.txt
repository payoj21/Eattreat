5833	Sneak Out To What A Comic Show For Books, Comics & Drinks	<p>Comic-book nerds, rejoice! Thanks to a comic-themed restaurant and the hippest hangout in town. <strong>Chatpati Diaries</strong> takes us through their fun-filled visit to What A Comic Show in SDA.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dream Decor For A Comic Fanatic</strong></h4><p>With a hanging upside down action figurine of Spiderman on the window glass and a life-sized frame of Superman, comic-book fans will feel right at home at What A Comic Show (WACS). When you walk into a place like this, it takes you back to your childhood and makes you remember why you got into comics. Here, you’ll get the flashback of those days where comic characters were our real heroes and how we mimicked ninja by using scales as swords or the supernatural devil looking investigator, Hellboy.</p><p>Being a hardcore comic fanatic, I was in love with their ambience. There are comics everywhere &#8211; on the walls, as collages on the table tops, and even full issues on the table to read while you wait for your food. It was indeed a joy when I spotted my favourite Iron man action figure. The walls display countless memorabilia from Marvel &amp; other comics, including  head busts, figurines and movie posters. It provides excellent customer service in a friendly home-style environment.  Customers can play any of the board games at any time. The restaurant is essentially my dream fan-cave brought to life!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Than Just Another Restaurant</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">Located at Safdarjung Development Area Market near Delhi, IIT Gate, this new-age restaurant started by food lover and comic world fan-Pooja Moirangthem is one of a kind. Being a budding entrepreneur, Pooja has been in the travel industry for almost a decade and then decided to hang her boots as she always had the zest to start a unique and rejuvenating enterprise. The owner has meticulously handpicked and selected all the components of the business. They evenorganisee live acoustic musical nights, screening of super blockbusters in the genre of animation, superheroes costume parties and much more.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Lowdown On Food &amp; Drinks</strong></h4><p>I sat down and perused the drinks menu to see what references I could catch. A mocktail named <strong>Phantom Punch</strong> popped out immediately; it is a blend of lime soda, brown sugar with ginger syrup. Super healthy and refreshing drink. Then I opted for <strong>Frankenstein Blood</strong> which did not suit my taste bud. I felt the portion of tomato juice was too strong.</p><p>To get the complete essence of both Continental and Oriental delicacies, I chose <strong>Veg Platter</strong> from each. Former platter consists of crispy French fries, potato wedges, mushroom triangle toast which was a perfect delight and simple bruschetta with tasty topping. While the latter has spring rolls, stuffed potato, chilly paneer which were good but <strong>shabalay</strong> and <strong>wontons</strong> were a letdown. On the recommendation of our pretty host, I tried <strong>Crispy Corn Pepper Salt</strong> and BAM! It was an outburst of crunch and flavours. Here, I can say that spiciness was on point.</p><p>Then I had <strong>White Sauce Mushroom Pasta,</strong> which again, was brilliant. Up next was freshly made <strong>Egg Sandwich</strong> with a side of fries, which for once was just the right amount. It has a taste that lingers and will make you want to revisit.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14566214_994142657378642_3898701782273394578_o.jpg"><img title = "Sneak Out To What A Comic Show For Books, Comics &amp; Drinks  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5927" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14566214_994142657378642_3898701782273394578_o.jpg" alt = "SDA restaurant drinks continental Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14566214_994142657378642_3898701782273394578_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14566214_994142657378642_3898701782273394578_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14566214_994142657378642_3898701782273394578_o-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Sweet Take</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">Like we all know a food review is incomplete without a sweet take, so for dessert, I had <strong>Chocolate Brownie with Chocolate Ice-cream</strong> which was good.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Clearly, this is a different kind of establishment. One that makes everyone feel welcome. It is a geeked out nerd fest with great food. Like Jim Zub said ‘Comic is social’ and so is WACS.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/whatacomicshow/photos/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">What A Comic Show</a>.</p><p><em>This article was originally published on <a href="https://chatpatidiary.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/what-a-comic-show/" target="_blank">Chatpatidiaries</a>.</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>What A Comic Show</strong></em></p>
