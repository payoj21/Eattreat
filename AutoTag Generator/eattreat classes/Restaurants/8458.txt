8458	From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar & Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare	<p>The Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen launched a little over two weeks ago and has already started catching a lot of eyes for its decor and the concept of tailor-made food and drinks. They&#8217;re one of the newer theme restaurants in Delhi that aim&nbsp;to give its customers a unique experience.</p><h4><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>The Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen is designed on the concept of a tailor shop from the streets of Saville Row in London. The interiors are exquisitely intertwined with an aesthetically appealing ambience. The food and drinks are bespoken, and some of the dishes on the menu are even paired with the drinks that they have on offer. At the moment, they too do not serve alcohol, but they soon shall once the liquor licenses come in. They serve regional Indian food.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626.jpg"><img title = "From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8466" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626.jpg" alt = "restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5626-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The restaurant is located on the first floor, and the entrance may seem like a mystery at first unless someone guides you in. The entire restaurant is covered in tailor-themed motifs. One wall is entirely covered with table-top sewing machines, while another has cascading drawers. Some of the tables here look like spools of thread, and there are sections where there are thick ropes that make a grid-like pattern to represent the wefts and warps that make up fabric. Both the floors have a bar area. Additionally, the lower floor has a very stylish cigar lounge and the upper one has an outdoor seating arrangement where you can order hookah.</p><p>They also have lockers on the walls for safekeeping for when you’ve had one too many and accidentally leave your belongings like your wallet, keys, etc. What&#8217;s more is that they have a small stage area for live performances, which they plan to have every week.</p><h4><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>We do love sitting outside, but it can be a bummer in the summer. You could sit at one of the tables on the upper floor where there’s more seating space, or at the bar below. The speciality of the bar on the lower floor is that it’s designed in a way that, no matter where you sit, you’ll be able to see everyone who’s seated at the bar.</p><h4><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952.jpg"><img title = "From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  "class="alignnone wp-image-8460 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952.jpg" alt = "restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5952-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>One of the first things we noticed is the Instagram-friendly plates that they serve their food in. The plates are elliptical and slightly raised on one end&nbsp;so that when you take all those photos for social media with your phone, your plate looks the prettiest.</p><p>Crockery aside, you must try the spicy <strong>Kuliye Ki Chaat</strong> if you feel that going all the way to Old Delhi is a daunting task. Get the <strong>Aloo Aur Khumani Ki Tikki</strong> if you want aloo tikki that’s both spicy and sweet, with candied apricot on top. They also have some really nice <strong>Channa Keema Samosa</strong> on the menu that has a magenta colour skin owing to the beetroot juice they’ve put in the dough. It&#8217;s pretty and tasty but it may just feel a little dry to your mouth.</p><p>Next, get the <strong>Rampuri Mutton Khichda</strong>. This is one of the nicest things we’ve had in a while, and we can definitely see ourselves wanting to visit soon just for this for the comfort food feels of this dish. Also get the <strong>Sabudana Khichdi</strong>, which is a great vegetarian variant.</p><h4><strong>Raise A Toast to</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947.jpg"><img title = "From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  "class="alignnone wp-image-8462 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947.jpg" alt = "restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5947-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They’ve got a bunch of mocktails and other cold and hot drinks on their menu, but we got this really thick <strong>Oreo Shake</strong>, which in itself is enough for you to keep sipping on throughout the meal. It’s flavoured with chocolate syrup, Oreos, and KitKat, and you can identify each of them individually. We also got this carrot and beetroot cold pressed juice called the <strong>Blood Bath</strong>, and their own version of the non-alcoholic Bloody Mary, called <strong>Gulaabo</strong>. Gulaabo is a slightly milder version of the Bloody Mary, but they’d made it a little spicy with the inclusion of green chillies.</p><h4><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972.jpg"><img title = "From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  From London To Connaught Place, Newly-Opened Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen Brings Tailor-Made Fare  "class="alignnone wp-image-8463 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972.jpg" alt = "restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   restaurants mid range Indian Category:Restaurants casual dining   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5972-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The coffee flavoured <strong>Kerala Fish Curry</strong> is a hit and a miss, as people may or may not like getting coffee beans in their mouth while eating fish. Also, it was a tad overdone, but that may be preffered by people wholike their fish a little well done.<br />They’ve got only two desserts on the menu, and they’re the more ordinary items on the menu. <strong>I-Ma-Gin</strong> is a strawberry sorbet, that’s decorated with freshly cut kiwis and strawberries and served with a small bowlful of their version of the creme brulee. The creme brulee was unnecessary, and the sorbet was lumpy and way too tart. The <strong>Gajrela Mini Pies with a Wasabi Panjiri</strong> is essentially a tart shell with gajar halwa topped with oodles of condensed milk and the panjiri tasted like sawdust.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>In a world where Instagram-friendly dishes and decor are becoming the norm, The Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen is doing everything right. You must go for the great selection of music, and the fun decor.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> H-55, 1st Floor, Outer Circle, Connaught Place, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 45644700,+91 9311714702</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 1500 for two people (approx.)</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheDarziBar/?fref=ts" target="_blank">The Darzi Bar &amp; Kitchen</a>.</p>
