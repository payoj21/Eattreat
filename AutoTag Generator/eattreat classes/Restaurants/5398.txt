5398	The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again	<p>A stroll around the inner circle of Connaught Place, and you’re met with the restaurants here that were established before Independence. You’re transported straight to the colonial times as soon as you step in. And the United Coffee House menu keeps us coming back time and again.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/United-Coffee-House.jpg"><img title = "The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5400" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/United-Coffee-House.jpg" alt = "north Indian heritage English continental Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/United-Coffee-House.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/United-Coffee-House-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/United-Coffee-House-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>United Coffee House is one of those places that we’ve grown up seeing whenever we walk around the <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//colonnade-cp-coming-heres-everything-will-house/">many blocks in CP</a>. The decor here is inspired from the times when the British were still in India, and you can immediately notice the gold framed heavily embossed velvet fabric on the walls, and the two huge chandeliers that are suspended from the ceiling to give it a regal air.<br />The United Coffee House menu comprises about 450 dishes from various cuisines, and they have a page dedicated to the classics that have worked for UCH ever since they first opened their doors in 1942.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>We’d say that the perfect spot to sit here is the balcony, that provides a certain level of privacy in the otherwise busy restaurant. Whether you’re here with your family, or just for a meeting, this would be the best place.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>We only had their <strong>Lemon Ice Tea</strong> and their <strong>Peach Ice Tea</strong>, which were both delicious and refreshing. Just the perfect thing for when you’re here for a meeting and just need something to sip on while you’re going about your work.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cheese-Balls.jpg"><img title = "The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again  The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5399" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cheese-Balls.jpg" alt = "north Indian heritage English continental Category:Restaurants   north Indian heritage English continental Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cheese-Balls.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cheese-Balls-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cheese-Balls-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You must get some of their classics, like the <strong>Cheese Balls</strong>, and the <strong>Chicken A la Kiev</strong>. One bite into each of them, and we instantly knew why they’re both things that their patrons order often. The Cheese Balls are a great mid-afternoon snack, and the chicken is just the thing you should get for lunch. The portion sizes are bigger than you’d expect, so you should order these when you’re extremely hungry.</p><p>If you’re someone who doesn’t really like chicken so much, get the <strong>Cottage Cheese Extravaganza</strong>. It’s a lovely dish that comes with a side of veggies that are grilled to perfection. So. Good.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Baked-Alaska.jpg"><img title = "The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again  The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again  The United Coffee House Menu Is Making The Classics Cool Again  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5402" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Baked-Alaska.jpg" alt = "north Indian heritage English continental Category:Restaurants   north Indian heritage English continental Category:Restaurants   north Indian heritage English continental Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Baked-Alaska.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Baked-Alaska-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Baked-Alaska-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>While the other things we got felt like they justified the amount one would pay for the dishes on the United Coffee House menu, you’d be surprised to see just one big samosa when you order the <strong>Keema Samosa</strong>. We feel that while it was delicious, it was a little dry. We were expecting several smaller portions of the same. Also, the <strong>Baked Alaska</strong> is blowtorched instead of baked in an oven, which gave us the taste of raw egg white when we took our first spoonful. The presentation could do with some improvement as well.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>United Coffee House is the perfect place for when you want to get the fine-dining experience without having to go to a hotel. The food here is great, and you’d get value for the money you spend.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theunitedgroup.uch/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
