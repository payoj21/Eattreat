5136	Take A Trip To These Places For Sarson Saag & Makke Di Roti	<p>Every Punjabi person knows winters mean sarson saag and makke ki roti for dinner and Sunday brunch. While it&#8217;s best cooked at home, not everyone wants to invest the effort that goes into it. If you are one of those people who are looking to eat this rich dish without the hassle of cooking it (we sure are), hit these places for a scrumptious meal!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>A good meal of saag is best accompanied by family time and a long drive, so instead of navigating through Old Delhi, head over to Murthal to get yourself some this Punjabi dish!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Haveli Heritage</strong></h4><p>Haveli is one of the most prominent places in Murthal. Their grandeur decor and explicable service along with mouth-watering food are reasons enough for us head here. Come winters and they introduce everyone’s favourite sarson saag, served with generous amount of fresh white butter, giving us extra incentives for the trip.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://haveliheritage.net/murthal/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chowki Dhani</strong></h4><p>When Jaipur’s beloved Chowki Dhani opened on GT Karnal road, we rejoiced with happiness. It is a complete package with everything from entertainment and food incorporated in this themed resort. So, make a day out of it and go grab some sarson saag here, because they serve it with love and care. Their menu often differs so call them ahead of time to be sure.</p><p>Explore more <a href="http://www.chokhidhanisonipat.com/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sukhdev Dhaba </strong></h4><p>Murthal’s most famous dhaba, Sukhdev always has a long waiting line for tables (and cars)! But their food is definitely worth the wait. While we normally hit the place for stuffed parathas, we also love their sarson saag. Sometimes we just end up eating both! Keep some time on your hand if you plan to visit Sukhdev, because you will definitely have to be patient before you get a seat!</p><p>Explore more <a href="http://amriksukhdev.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
