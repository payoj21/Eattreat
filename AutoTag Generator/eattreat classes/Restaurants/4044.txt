4044	Coconut, Kokum & Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi	<p>The opening of restaurants focusing on regional Indian cuisine seems to have become the trend this year. Auro Kitchen and Bar, located in the heart of Delhi is doing just that, but has brought a plethora of flavours that the city is yet to experience.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Auro Kitchen &amp; Bar has only opened recently, but has already become the talk of the town. They serve food inspired from the cuisines of the west side of the coastal region of the country, but they also serve a few dishes from the north-eastern cuisine.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cherry Picked</strong></h4><p>The best place to be seated is anywhere near the periphery of the terrace, whether you go in the late afternoon or for dinner. The entire vibe of the place is quite chilled out, and is also great if you want to <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//4-best-places-in-the-city-for-you-to-host-your-party-this-winter/" target="_blank">host a party</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4113.jpg"><img title = "Coconut, Kokum &amp; Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4053" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4113.jpg" alt = "regional new drinks coastal bar   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4113.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4113-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4113-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The restaurant is yet to get the liquor license, so we’re quite excited to see what they have up their sleeve. For the time being, we tried the <strong>Chocolate Pear Shake</strong> that wasn’t all that stellar but tasted great. The <strong>Flower Power</strong> iced tea is good too, and it tasted like an iced version of the Kashmiri Kahwa.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>We can’t even begin to tell you how much we loved the <strong>Pumpkin and Coconut Soup</strong>. It wasn’t overly spiced, the caramelised onions added to the sweetness, and the little pepper that they had put in provided sufficient heat. We also loved the <strong>Vindaloo Pork Ribs</strong> that literally fell off the bone, the <strong>Tandoori Mushrooms</strong> that were grilled to perfection, and the <strong>Pulled Jackfruit Fajitas</strong> just blew our mind!</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4111.jpg"><img title = "Coconut, Kokum &amp; Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi  Coconut, Kokum &amp; Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4052" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4111.jpg" alt = "regional new drinks coastal bar   regional new drinks coastal bar   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4111.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4111-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4111-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a><br />We ended our meal with the very delicious <strong>Chargrilled Gulab Jamun with Rose Mascarpone</strong> which was like fireworks in our mouths.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The tingmo in the <strong>Tingmo Hotdog</strong> was a little hard, and the sausage itself was too dry for the mouth. The <strong>Gunpowder Chicken Popcorn</strong> was just chicken popcorn coated with gunpowder and served with more gunpowder. The <strong>Watermelon Iced Tea</strong> was a little bland and could have done with a little mint and a little more watermelon syrup.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4115.jpg"><img title = "Coconut, Kokum &amp; Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi  Coconut, Kokum &amp; Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi  Coconut, Kokum &amp; Peanuts: Auro Brings Flavours Of The West Coast To Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4054" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4115.jpg" alt = "regional new drinks coastal bar   regional new drinks coastal bar   regional new drinks coastal bar   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4115.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4115-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_4115-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Auro is a great new place in town that serves delicious regional food from the western coastal region of the country.
