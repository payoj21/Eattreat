2463	Light Up Your Taste Buds At Lanterns Kitchen And Bar	<p>Ever since its revamp, Lanterns Kitchen and Bar has been gaining popularity as a bar with a youthful vibe. We went and scoured the place and here&#8217;s why you should be turning up there, more often than not.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">Lanterns is a casual dining restaurant-cum-bar that has recently undergone a makeover. It has become, over the years, a regular watering hole for college students and young professionals alike, mainly because of how pocket-friendly it is. They serve North Indian, Mughlai, and Chinese cuisines, with DJ and live bands performing every week to keep up the mood.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cherry Picked</strong></h4><p>At the moment, Lanterns only has indoor seating, but we hear that they will soon have an extended courtyard area near the entrance. If you go when there’s still light outside, you should definitely be sitting at the space near the windows. It’s perfect for instagrammin’ all those beautiful food shots!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>If you feel like you’re in the mood to really bring the house down and party, you simply cannot miss the Jager Mojito. It is as sweet as it is boozy, and can get you buzzing soon enough.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On A Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>The Chapta Kebab with Varqi Paratha is definitely something you need to sample. The kebab was well done with just the right amount of spices and it almost literally melts in your mouth. The paratha goes with it quite perfectly, so much so that we&#8217;re lovingly using the phrase, “You are the Chapta Kebab to my Varqi Paratha” (Ok, maybe that’s taking things a bit too far!).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The restaurant is located in a moderately busy commercial complex, near a bunch of liquor shops. While it doesn’t affect your dining experience so much, you might want to be a little careful while making your way out since the stairs and the parking area are not very well lit.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>You should go to Lanterns Kitchen and Bar if you want to hang back with a few beers or cocktails with friends from work for the ambience, the food, and their good taste in music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lanternsreskitchen/?fref=ts">Lanterns</a> at 163 &amp; 164, Rajendra Place, where you can enjoy all that they have to offer every day between 12:15 pm to 1:00 am.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Lanterns Kitchen and Bar</strong></em></p>
