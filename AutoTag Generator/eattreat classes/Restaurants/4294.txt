4294	You Can Let The Dogs Out At These Pet-Friendly Cafes In Delhi	<p>Living in the city certainly has its perks, for instance, the concept of a dog cafe. But, we often find ourselves having to leave our four-legged family members behind when we go for lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, and we’re tired of taking them to the same old parks and watching them ruin their coats by rolling in the mud. Here are some pet-friendly places in the city for you to go exploring with your pet.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Brown Box</strong></h4><p>This is the perfect dog cafe to be at when you just feel like hanging out with your puppy in the space outside the bakery-café with a cup of their freshly brewed coffee, or your favourite dessert.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The.Brown.Box.Bakery/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Puppychino</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PUPPYCHINO.jpg"><img title = "You Can Let The Dogs Out At These Pet-Friendly Cafes In Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4298" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PUPPYCHINO.jpg" alt = "  " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PUPPYCHINO.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PUPPYCHINO-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PUPPYCHINO-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Located centrally, Puppychino is fairly new to the city.
