5295	This Barbeque Grill Makes It Super Easy To Roast & Toast At Home! 	<p>Weber launched in India in January 2016 and we instantly fell in love with their barbeque grill! If barbeque wasn’t reason enough, Weber has brought everything you can possibly need into these by ensuring you can bake, roast and even smoke your food; making this one the most productive barbeque grill you can get for your kitchen.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Spitfire Barbeque Grill</strong></h4><p>Weber sets itself apart with the concept of “closed-lid grilling” and very rightly so. Their barbeque grills are classified into three categories &#8211; charcoal, gas and premium. While the much adored and old-fashioned<strong> charcoal grill</strong> might seem difficult to use, we can assure you it is not! They&#8217;re easy to use and have a light charcoal system, along with charcoal shells that are 100% organic, which make this an easy-breezy 5 mins process followed by barely 20 mins wait time (significantly less that the typical coal). Available in different sizes and a portable version, we highly recommend these!</p><p>The <strong>gas grill</strong> is even easier to use, with knobs attached to control the temperature and different outlets. It gives just as good a result, but you lose the old-school barbeque vibe. Their <strong>premium grills</strong> will leave you stunned. Normally used by the hospitality sector, these are truly jaw-dropping! Available with a rotisserie option, it takes grilling to a whole new level. If we had a big backyard or lived in a farmhouse, we would be grabbing this, no questions asked!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Academy</strong></h4><p>Grill Academy is the concept pioneered by Weber in order educate us about the authentic way of grilling and to make it an everyday product for them to use at home, taking customer service to new heights. The Grill Academy in Ghitorni, MG Road gives a very hands-on experience, it allows you to not just learn the process but also experience it. Keeping the classes in small groups, Chef Melwin pays attention to every person ensuring they absorb the knowledge but also have fun while doing so.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In Fact, We Tried A Class!</strong></h4><p>While the Indian perception often limits barbeque to tikkas and skewers, the class taught us just how much more a grill can achieve (especially if it’s a Weber grill)! Starting off with making a pizza (you can actually roll the dough, spin it around and have a blast) we realised how perfect crust can be achieved by this covered-lid grill.</p><p>Followed by a roasted full chicken smoked with apple wood, we were in awe. Smoking is such a beautiful technique, infusing the meat with flavours without adding spices. They even have a list of woods you should be using for different meats and we loved every bit of it. Since, barbequing, smoking and grilling wasn’t enough we moved on to baking. A banana bread on the charcoal barbeque grill (a blasphemy!). Only to be proven wrong about said blasphemy.</p><p>It came out soft and moist, even more than the one we make at home (in the oven)! We ended the class mesmerised by the Weber barbeque grill range and determined about our Christmas gift (portable barbeque grill? Hell yeah)!</p><p>Explore more <a href="http://www.weberindia.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
