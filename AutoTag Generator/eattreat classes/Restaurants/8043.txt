8043	Chidambaram’s New Madras Hotel Does A Mean Three-In-One Rava Dosa & Dahi Vada	<p>Anubhav Sapra, from Delhi Food Walks, is giving us his favourite place to try amazing South Indian at. And we won&#8217;t say no to such gems of knowledge!</p><hr><p>The other day, I was invited for a meeting at India Habitat Centre to plan an event to be held sometime next week. The meeting got delayed by an hour because no one including the person who called the meeting was on time. Taking the opportunity, I decided to explore the good eateries and food of Khanna Market. I asked the auto rickshaw driver to drop me at any place where I can have my brunch. He had a great foodie instinct and straightaway dropped me at Chidambaram’s New Madras Hotel, famous for South Indian food.</p><h4><strong>What Transpired!</strong></h4><p>The restaurant is owned by C. Kumar and C.Raju Chidambaram who started the restaurant is no more. It was opened in 1930 to provide food to officers in the British Government who were from South India. In 1950, they had moved to this new place in Khanna market.&nbsp;</p><div><p>We ordered a <strong>three-in-one&nbsp;rava dosa</strong> (INR 90) and a plate of <strong>dahi vada</strong>. It was served on a plate covered with banana leaves. The three portions of the dosa had three different fillings-paneer masala, potato masala and crushed coconut. The 3 in 1 rava dosa was crispy and well stuffed. Sambhar and coconut chutney was awesome. It was truly delectable. They first serve hot spicy<strong> rasam</strong> which one can sip to wait for the ordered food.We also ordered for dahi vada which was equally good.</p><p>The nice ambience, wide range of food and friendly staff make Chidambaram’s New Madras Hotel Restaurant a place worth visiting!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;Chidambaram’s New Madras Hotel, Shop No.7, Khanna Market, Lodhi Road</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;24611726, 24617702, 9312220478, 9811301534</p><p><em>Representative Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons&nbsp;</strong></em></p></div>
