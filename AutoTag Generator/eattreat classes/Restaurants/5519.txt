5519	Soul Food Central: Cafe Shunya Is Reinventing Healthy European Food	<p>An establishment just shy of 40 days since opening, this bright cafe will definitely catch your eye. Decorated very tastefully with simplistic clean interiors, a white and black colour scheme, intriguing prints and wooden tables you will get a warm vibe as soon as you enter. And we can only go on about the European food.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Aimed at revolutionising the way people think of healthy food, Cafe Shunya is a vegetarian cafe with options for vegan and gluten-free meals (and not just a few). Their meals are comforting and in winters, almost like a food hug! Incorporating Indian local ingredients, quite a few grown on their own farm like tulsi, it&#8217;s all about quality products.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>Right next to the entrance, a small spot with Japanese style seating is ideal for spending long hours here. Highly resembling the Indian way of eating food, it is endearing to see how well its incorporated in the cafe. The ample sunshine through the windows really enhances the experience.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>A whole lot of options from juices, smoothies and teas put us in a head-spin, but a few truly stood out. Cold brew iced <b>Himalayan tea with pomegranate flowers</b> is #refreshing AF. Full flavoured yet not bitter, it&#8217;s a must have. <b>Tisane with ashwagandha</b> is another stellar choice. The aroma itself is enough to send you in a heavenly trance. <b>Kanji</b> is as original and wintery as it gets, so don’t hesitate to take a sip.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4551.jpg"><img title = "Soul Food Central: Cafe Shunya Is Reinventing Healthy European Food  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5557" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4551.jpg" alt = "lunch gurgaon European Category:Restaurants breakfast   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4551.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4551-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4551-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>In for a breakfast? Try the <b>french toast with creamy gulab muraba</b>, overdosed with nostalgic memories of french toast &amp; muraba, the soft hints of rose and fluffiness of these egg toasts are everything you need to make your day memorable with European food! The <b>spinach goats cheese pizza with curry leaves</b> is just as amazing. Loaded with cheese, the creaminess is cut by the crunch and flavour of curry leaves. The soul-bowl with <b>sun squash and penne </b>is ideal for warm winter lunches. Desserts and sweets are must, so try the <b>coconut-date laddoo</b> or<a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//rum-cake-12-days-christmas-special/"> <b>old monk waffles</b> </a>with chironji seeds.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>We loved every bit of this cafe, from the ambience and food to drinks. However, being recently opened they are still working out glitches with service, though it’s not enough to deter us from going back again.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought </strong></h4><p>We love Cafe Shunya for all things healthy, delicious, Indian and European. Though not classified as fusion food, we love how they have infused and highlighted all dishes with truly Indian ingredients found so commonly at homes, that they aren&#8217;t even available for mass distribution and incorporated them in European food. Thus, the need to grow them on their own farms. Allowing ingredients quality to shine whether it&#8217;s in a soul-bowl or pizza is what makes them truly unique.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafeshunya/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
