7196	Fatty Bao’s Ping Pong Brunch Will Give You Unlimited Sushis & Baos On Sundays	<p>RK Puram has suddenly become the place to hang out over lunch or a couple of drinks. More so when it comes to Asian cuisine. Ziu, Fatty Bao or even Café Delhi Heights serve pretty sensational Asian grub and we love the whole vibe that Sangam has going. That said, Fatty Bao never ceases to amaze with its well-thought-out menus and Sunday brunch specials. Head to Fatty Bao for your weekly Sunday brunch in Delhi.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>We tried the Ping Pong brunch and we’re happy to say that this one is going to be around for a while. The terrace restaurant has installed table tennis equipment so that you can really win your meal after. So get a drink, use that hand-eye coordination to have and play some ball. And there’s always sushi after.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>Since the weather is nice and windy, we recommend you take a seat on the terrace. In case you don’t want to hang out in the open, then the beautiful interiors also make for a cosy space on a winter afternoon.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>We upped the ante with a <strong>Wasabi Drop</strong> that’s just great if you like your drinks with a splash of pungency. The <strong>Forbidden Fruit</strong> was also quite impressive but a tad too sweet with the plum puree and grapefruit ginger syrup. The <strong>Mickey Ninja</strong> is our fave drink from the Fatty Bao menu and as always, it didn&#8217;t fail us.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2.jpg"><img title = "Fatty Bao’s Ping Pong Brunch Will Give You Unlimited Sushis &amp; Baos On Sundays  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7320" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2.jpg" alt = "Thai restaurant Chinese Category:Restaurants casual dining Brunch asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ping-pong2-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>With a bunch of <strong>unlimited</strong> <strong>sushis</strong> and <strong>baos</strong> at your fingertips on a Sunday, it can get a bit mad for you to choose from their excellent selection. We had a particularly good time with the <strong>Prawn Tempura</strong>, <strong>California Roll</strong> and the <strong>Chicken &amp; Asparagus Dimsum</strong>.</p><p>What stood out completely for us was the spicy <strong>Crispy Calamari</strong> which is tossed in a green chutney to die for. And if you like your post drink snack, then we’d recommend the <strong>Stir Fry Kimchi Pork</strong>. The classic <strong>Teriyaki Glazed Chicken Bao</strong> also made an entrance, but we definitely like the assortment on the main menu for baos.</p><p>As always, the dessert is unusual as ever. The <strong>Dorayaki</strong> is a set of Japanese matcha pancakes with dark chocolate, sea salt and hazelnuts poured in between the layers. This comes with a vanilla bean ice-cream which concludes the whole brunch with zero loose ends.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>While the whole brunch is really well done, it is the exotic vegetable sushis that were a tad disappointing. But there’s a lot to choose from, from the vegetarian menu as well. So you better be prepped.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>An unlimited brunch at Fatty Bao sound too good to be true, but here it is. They do some great drinks and desserts, and we honestly can’t think of a better way to spend our time other than trying on the <strong>Green Mango and Papaya Salad </strong>at this Sunday brunch in Delhi. And it’s going to be here until at least the end of March!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Sangam Courtyard, Major Somnath Marg, Sector 9, R.K.
