3709	A British Pub, Matchbox Is Giving Us Serious Beer Goals	<p>A pint of beer, some finger food, your friends cheering for their favourite teams, a big screen playing the football match, sports flags on the walls &#8211; if that’s your dream for the next match, head over to Matchbox Pub and Grub!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell </strong></h4><p>A classic British Pub, Matchbox is tucked in a quaint corner next to Talli Singh in Sector-29. Hit the spot for a relaxed evening or a heated football match.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>They are planning an outside seating for winters. Cold breeze, comfort food, a relaxed conversation and some cocktails, we can’t wait for it! Till then, choose the sofa seating next to windows for some lighting and a nice view of the screen.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>Try out their <strong>filo wraps stuffed with cheese and bell peppers</strong>, dipped in a sticky chilli sauce, we are going to be dreaming about these for a while! If you are looking for something more filling, opt for the <strong>sizzlers</strong>. We absolutely loved the <strong>cottage cheese sizzler</strong> topped with <strong>barbeque sauce</strong>. The quality of cottage cheese was exceptional and paired with vegetables, it was flavourful and healthy.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>If you are here for beer, we don&#8217;t need to tell you what to order. But if you want something non-alcoholic, try their <strong>chocolate shake</strong>. Creamy and indulgent, it&#8217;s perfect to accompany your food.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill </strong></h4><p>We would suggest steering clear of the <strong>Caesar Salad</strong>, it was quite salty and basic.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Overall, we think Matchbox is pretty great for a pub; the music, vibe, ambience and food, everything is on point.</p><p><b>#EatExtra:</b> They conduct DJ nights every weekend and karaoke nights on Thursdays. You should definitely not miss the Retro Sundays!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Matchboxggn/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
