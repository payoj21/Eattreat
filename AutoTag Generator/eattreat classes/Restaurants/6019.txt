There is a range of<strong> carpaccio</strong> that has been created. There is lamb, steak and octopus on offer. The best part of the carpaccio cut is the explosion of the flavours the meat provides in tandem with the dressing. We also tried out some pecorino with smoked salami and an authentic aged <strong>Negroni</strong> to wash it down. There is also a <strong>Bruschetta trolley</strong> (Cicetti Section) to impress upon you the fresh flavours of Italy. Try out the classic <strong>Pomodoro with Rocket leaves and Parmesan cheese</strong> which leaves a mouthful of sweetness and salty flavours on the palate.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Primo &amp; Secondo</strong></h4><p>The mains of the Italian Sunday Brunch includes some of the best pastas, Neapolitan pizzas and grills available. We tried out the <strong>Casarecce with Pork Nduja and Egg Plant</strong> which exploded on our palate with the flavours. But a Risotto is always a true indicator of an Italian restaurant and Chef Ferraro nails the <strong>mushroom Risotto</strong> with the perfect amount of chalkiness. The <strong>medium rare tenderloin steak</strong> is done perfectly along with a side of roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. There are<strong> lamb chops</strong> and <strong>pork chops</strong> along with a plethora of seafood available as well.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dolce</strong></h4><p>We end our meal with some desserts from all over Europe. The <strong>Chocolate Mille-Feuille</strong> and the <strong>Berry Cheesecake </strong>make for excellent ways to end a meal. This Sunday brunch is available at Sorrento, Shangri-La’s Eros Hotel for INR 3750++ with cocktails every Sunday.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShangrilaNewDelhi/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
