6174	Townhall Is Opening In Gurgaon! And So Are A Bunch Of New Restaurants	<p>When Townhall opened its doors in Khan Market in 2014, little did anyone know that this restaurant will soon become a landmark of sorts. An eclectic atmosphere, where Chef Augusto Cabrera belts out signature sushi and World Cuisine, Townhall Khan Market has shown Delhi how to have a good time.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>A decade ago, when Threesixty opened at The Oberoi, New Delhi, Augusto Cabrera was the sushi master and he sure cast his spell on Delhi, which warmed up to Sushi at his genius stroke. The trio of <strong>Mr. Choy</strong>, <strong>Public Affair</strong> and <strong>Townhall</strong> make Khan Market what it is and we have to say, this group is exceptionally impressive with their fare.</p><p>What’s more, is that we hear Townhall is soon going to hit Gurgaon. Yep, you got us right. G-town is abuzz with news that Townhall is soon to open at Two Horizon Centre, Gold Course Road. What we love so much about TownHall Khan Market, apart from the quirky, relaxed ambience are the Rainbow Rolls (Chef Augusto’s Signature rolls) and the Filipino Barbeque Pork belly.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>Want to know what else is coming to Two Horizon Center? We hear that the mall is all set to welcome <strong>Pa Pa Ya</strong>, <strong>Pizza Express</strong>, <strong>Delhi Club House</strong> and <strong>Artusi</strong>. We also hear the entrance of a new South American food expert, <strong>Whisky Samba</strong>. Well, if that isn&#8217;t making you hop and skip to Gurgaon, we don&#8217;t know what will.</p><p>Follow Townhall <a href="https://www.facebook.com/townhallkm/" target="_blank">here</a></p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of <strong>Townhall</strong></em></p>
