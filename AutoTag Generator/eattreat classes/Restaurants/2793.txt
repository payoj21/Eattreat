The <strong>Spicy Salmon Roll</strong>, <strong>California Roll</strong>, <strong>Salmon Expression with wasabi and galangal </strong>are the perfect mix for your taste buds.</p><p>As if the vibrant interiors weren’t enough, the dishes&nbsp;are equally enigmatic: <strong>Prawn Tempura</strong>, <strong>Chicken Karage</strong>, and <strong>Pork Belly</strong> are some of their signature dishes. The Pork Belly is served with the <strong>Soy Honey Sauce glazed with Mustard Miso Sauce</strong> and wasabi on the plate. The Prawn Tempura is crisp and the Chicken Karage is a marinated fried chicken with spicy Kewpie Sauce.</p><p>Their <strong>Mushroom Takikome Rice</strong> is the perfect blend of sticky rice, vegetables and mushrooms. For dessert, order the red velvet cake, which is probably the best way to end this Japanese love-saga!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>They have some refreshing cocktails and mocktails on their drinks menu—you can&#8217;t miss out on the <strong>Wasabi Cocktail</strong>, <strong>Sendai</strong> (vodka, kiwi, fresh lemon, lime), <strong>Plum Blossom</strong> (Sochu, fresh plum, wine). If you&#8217;re a wine fanatic, you will love their <strong>rose wine</strong> and <strong>mulled wine</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image3.jpg"><img title = "For The Love Of Japanese &amp; Anime: Guppy Is Sushi &amp; Sashimi Goals  For The Love Of Japanese &amp; Anime: Guppy Is Sushi &amp; Sashimi Goals  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2798" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image3.jpg" alt = "seafood restaurants japanese Category:Restaurants casual dining   seafood restaurants japanese Category:Restaurants casual dining   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image3.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image3-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image3-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>Afternoons are usually crowded at this popular joint, especially Sunday. You will need a reservation, otherwise getting a table can be a nuisance. Prices are slightly steep, but the food is totally worth shedding a couple thousands.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>The <strong>Black Cod</strong> is not just their speciality but top-notch in every sense.&nbsp;Guppy is a chef-driven restaurant. If there&#8217;s something you want that’s not on the menu (however exhaustive the menu is), they make it a point to serve you the dish. Their Sunday Brunches have an assortment of Japanese delicacies with a wide range of soups, appetisers, sushi, tempura and so much more.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 28, Main Market, Lodhi Colony or explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Guppybyai/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at<span class="_xdb">&nbsp;</span><span class="_Xbe _ZWk kno-fv"><span data-dtype="d3ph">011 2469 0005</span></span></p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 2900+ for two</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Shreya Ahuja</strong></em></p>
