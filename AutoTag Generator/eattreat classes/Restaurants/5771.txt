5771	The Great Rajasthan Food Trail Decoded For Your Weekend Getaway	<p>Whenever one thinks of food trails, it&#8217;s always about the closest possible place to the city where one can experience the regional delicacies and culture without having to stay away from home for longer than necessary. Rajasthan is one of the easiest options for when you want to do one of your own — over the span of a weekend! We&#8217;re telling you the places that you can check off of your lists from Delhi to Ranthambore the next time you plan your trail.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gangaur Resort</strong></h4><p>If you&#8217;ve left your home at ungodly hours so you can get to your destination quickly, you should stop to refuel yourself so the journey isn&#8217;t too hard on you. Stop at Gangaur Resort and get their <strong>poori-bhaji</strong> for brekkie. You could get sandwiches, and omelettes of your choice in case you only want to get a little finger food before moving.The place itself isn&#8217;t very huge, but it can accommodate quite a number of people. Don&#8217;t sit on the grass, though. It will still be covered in dew drops.</p><p>The place itself isn&#8217;t very huge, but it can accommodate quite a number of people.

You&#8217;re going to be greeted by the locals who&#8217;ll wrap turbans around your head, and apply little dots of kumkum on your forehead-the standard welcome that one might receive when you go to a new place.</p><p>The camels will take you into the desert since it&#8217;ll be difficult for your car to do so without getting stuck a couple of times. You could do the touristy thing here by wearing the traditional clothes on display and getting photos clicked. You&#8217;ll also see musicians, dancers, and a fire show put on for you, and you can enjoy all of this with a cup of hot tea and batter fried veggies (<strong>pakoras</strong>). The best time to be at the dunes is closer to sunset, for there&#8217;s nothing more picturesque than that.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dinner At Ganehra Village</strong></h4><p>Our hosts,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/justdelhiing/"> Just Delhiing</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/inspired_traveller/">Inspired Traveller</a> had arranged for dinner at a remote village close to the dunes. The camels that you would have ridden on the back of can bring you here, but the journey can be long and tiring. So, if you feel that you&#8217;ve had enough adventure for a day, you could either get one of the camel carts or drive over.<br />Here, you can get more regional specialities like the <strong>Laal Maas</strong>,<strong> Malpua</strong>, <strong>Dal Baati Churma</strong>, and their special <strong>Halwa</strong>. The musicians here will sing anything ranging from Rajasthani folk songs, to ghazals and popular Bollywood numbers.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Stay at The Orchard</strong></h4><p>The Orchard is just a few minutes away from the place where you’d gotten dinner from. They’ve got 15 huge air-conditioned luxury tents surrounded by lots of greenery and small kitchen gardens. They’re very spacious and have queen size beds that can be converted into twin beds. Sheer silk curtains separate the bedroom from the living room and dressing area; and they also have heated bathrooms—perfect for when you’re back from your desert safari and dinner and just need a hot shower before turning in for the night. They also have the facility of a dining area that is just as pretty as the tents themselves.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Orchard-Resort-136321223056392/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Morning Tea At Pushkar Lake</strong></h4><p>We were fortunate enough to get to a workshop by Nathu Lalji of Coke Studio fame, who plays the Nagara and Nagari—traditional drums of Rajasthan. The session was fun and invigorating, to say the least. The chaiwallah here made what seemed like the best we’d had since the longest of times. It was piping hot, served in kulhad glasses, and was loaded with spices. You definitely need to get this tea.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Breakfast At Hotel Bharatpur Palace</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malpua.jpg"><img title = "The Great Rajasthan Food Trail Decoded For Your Weekend Getaway  The Great Rajasthan Food Trail Decoded For Your Weekend Getaway  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5809" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malpua.jpg" alt = "Rajasthan lunch food walk dinner Category:Restaurants   Rajasthan lunch food walk dinner Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malpua.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malpua-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malpua-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mayankforester/" target="_blank"><strong>Mayank Dhingra</strong></a></em></p><p>This hotel also overlooks Pushkar Lake which is more colourful and vibrant during the day, owing to the number of people who are here in their brilliantly coloured garbs.

You’re greeted with an icy mint lemonade that might give you brain freeze if you sip it too quickly, but is oh-so refreshing.</p><p>While you’re in this area of Pushkar, you should also check out the cafés here like Out Of The Blue and Funky Monkey. Also, don’t forget to look through the markets for some interesting things that you can pick up as gifts for when you go back home. Post this your Delhi to Ranthambore trip will come to fruition.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pushkarlapizzeria/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dinner &amp; Stay At Ranthambore Regency</strong></h4><p>If you haven’t been from Delhi to Ranthambore already, you should now. The spread at The Ranthambore Regency is quite lavish. One can find regional specialities, as well as continental food in the buffet. If you have any preferences, the chefs will be happy to help you with anything that you need.<br />The rooms themselves are quite decent and spacious. Pictures of tigers adorn the walls of the rooms and the corridors of the hotel. You could sit out near the pool with a personalised bonfire on a particularly cold night and listen to jungle stories.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ranthambhoreregency/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jungle Safari At Ranthambore National Park</strong></h4><p>One does not simply go and stay at Ranthambore National Park without taking the safari in the morning. You’ll be provided fleece blankets to keep you warm in the biting cold. Carry a muffler to wrap around your nose and ears so you don’t feel as cold, or else you could get earmuffs and woollen caps from one of the hawkers near the park entrance. The safari itself won’t be too long, but you will get to see the spotted deer, langurs, the Sambhar deer, (overly friendly) treepies, and if you’re lucky crocodiles and tigers. But, don’t get disappointed if you don’t get to see the latter. Enjoy the safari experience as a whole. Your Delhi to Ranthambore trip will be a success fersher.</p><p>From here on, you can choose to go back to your hotel and stay for lunch, visit the Ranthambore Fort, and make your journey back home, or you could stay back to try your luck and spot a tiger (or a few).</p><hr /><p>The Great Rajasthan Food Trail was organised by JustDelhiing and Inspired Traveller over 3 very eventful days, in collaboration with Honor phones and Chevrolet.</p>
