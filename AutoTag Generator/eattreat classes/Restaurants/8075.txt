8075	This Valentine’s Day The Imperial Is Ready To Play Host For Your Awesome Two-some	<p>The Imperial is one of our favourite places for a date night. Warm, welcoming and absolutely gorgeously done up, The Imperial has every right to be taken seriously when it comes to Valentine’s Day. They have tempting Valentine&#8217;s offers running at each of their five eateries (4 restaurants and one patisserie)and we are loving the vibe of each of them differently.&nbsp;</p><p>But this time they also have something new. They will host you for an excellent buffet lunch and dinner which has Continental and French flavours sprinkled throughout.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Want To Know What’s On The Menu?</strong></h4><p>1911 is a place that does buffet, and pulls all stops out for you to have a good time. A fresh <strong>Shrimp and romaine salad with grapes</strong> to start with that will have you prepped and ready for all the wonderful things to come. The <strong>Cauliflower bisque with lime and avocado</strong>&nbsp;comes next that is tangy and just the thing to share a plate of.&nbsp;</p><p>If your lover is a seafood fan (or not) the <strong>Crab and spinach stuffed sea bass</strong> is a sure winner (or will win them over!). Without the worry of these being sourced from the right place, since 1911 does a fabulous job of knowing the source of their produce.</p><p>Fear not if you have a penchant for the poultry. The <strong>Parmesan baked chicken, caramelized porcini</strong> is here to win you over, just like your significant other did, once upon a time. And nothing really speaks the language of love like potatoes, so welcome onboard the <strong>Fondant potatoes with brown butter and lemon</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Dessert-ed In Love?</strong></h4><p>Love and dessert just go together and of course, the good people of 1911, The Imperial understand that. You can choose from the goodness that is the <strong>Banana and brioche pudding</strong> or the <strong>Chocolate coated strawberries</strong>.
