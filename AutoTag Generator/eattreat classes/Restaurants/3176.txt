3176	This Couple At K9 Kitchen Have A Home-Delivery Service For Dogs!	<p>If you love spoiling your pooch with yummy treats or are considering nutritious food options instead of all the processed food that’s available in the market for your pet, this is where your worries end. Rajesh and Corina, a couple who live in Chennai will be starting the only food home-delivery service (in Chennai) called K9 Kitchen to cater to your hungry canine’s needs.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>They have done extensive research on all the different foods that are suitable for pets and have come up with a menu keeping in mind the pet owner’s preferences, since Tamil Nadu majorly has strictly vegetarian Iyer and Iyengar families. They only use the freshest ingredients for the soups and food (and not just hoomans deserve that luxury). They’ve also included a pasta dish in their menu, for that once-in-a-while treat that your pooch deserves for being such a good dog.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DOGFOOD5.jpg"><img title = "This Couple At K9 Kitchen Have A Home-Delivery Service For Dogs!

They’re currently only working out of their home kitchen in Iyyapanthangal.</p><p>They have daily and monthly packages for you to choose from, and even cater to the special nutrition needs of ailing dogs, on advance notice. The meal combos will be sorted by weight into 300 gram, 500 gram and 800 gram parcels for small, medium and large dogs respectively. Costing anywhere between INR 40 for a soup to INR 150 for a lavish beef or turkey roast, this menu may even have some folks without any pets calling in, for its competitive pricing.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/K9-Kitchen-761135297367296/" target="_blank">K9 Kitchen</a> will soon launch their delivery service on the 2nd of October to make it even more convenient for you.
