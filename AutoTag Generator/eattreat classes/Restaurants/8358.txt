8358	Indian Coffee House In CP Still Serves Food & Coffee At Phenomenally Low Prices	<p><strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong> takes us through the corridors of time, this time with&nbsp;Indian Coffee House in Delhi that Connaught Place continues to love today.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>A place where you have an almost ideal mix of sunlight and shade, where the wild and the civilized are in perfect harmony, no one disturbs while you brainstorm over a meal that is as cheap as it was quite a few years back. And when I say, “quite a few years back”, your mind takes you to just one place, yes Indian Coffee House.</p><p>The oldest café in Delhi, where revolutionaries and freedom fighters once met, greets you with unbelievably cheap prices and plenty of space to sit in. The balcony or the inner area is entirely up to you. The space is enough to accommodate the daily footfall but lacks maintenance. The benches might be a tad bit uncomfortable for some but they make you feel like the second floor of Mohansingh Palace has seized time.</p><h4><strong>Decrepit But Loved</strong></h4><p>The staff is polite but not too interested, their uniform which has lost its charm over the years still will fascinate you. Your order will take a minimum of 20 minutes to be served unless you have super-human communication skills or a constant smile on your face. My <strong>cold coffee with ice-cream</strong> and <strong>chowmein</strong> arrived in exactly 10 minutes and were both value for money. I played safe by filling my tummy with the popular items but you could also try <strong>Dosa</strong>, <strong>Scrambled eggs</strong> or the <strong>Cheese omelet</strong>. The food has that typically generic North Indian flavor to almost everything you but it is all served fresh and hot. You could probably try everything and even then the bill wouldn’t burn a hole in your pocket.</p><p>A few things to note about ICH are, first – the bamboo stick beside every table. These are to shoo away monkeys who stroll about almost every day. Second – the desperate fact that ICH needs a makeover or soon it will be nothing but a place that serves cheap food. Third –&nbsp; please carry a lot of patience and time when you visit ICH as you may just want to chill for a while.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;2nd Floor, Mohan Singh Place,&nbsp;Connaught Place</p><p>Say hello at&nbsp;011 23342994</p><p>Pay INR 200 for two</p><p><em>This story first appeared on<a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/indian-coffee-house/" target="_blank"><strong> Delhi Food Walks by Sanskrit Nagar</strong></a>.</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
