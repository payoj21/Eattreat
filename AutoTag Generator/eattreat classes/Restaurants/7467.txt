Guess that’s enough praise coming from a non-vegetarian. The&nbsp;White guy chicken burger with a double chicken patty and loads of caramelized onions, jerkinds and cheese was lip smacking.&nbsp;Bihari ghost Mutton burger is for spice lovers only. Superrrrr spicy Bihari sauce with onions and cheese.&nbsp;The morocco fries were tangy due to lemon and a good change from the usual.</p><div><div><p><strong>Head to&nbsp;</strong>Shop 2, Building C-21,&nbsp;SDA&nbsp;Market, Opposite IIT Delhi Gate, SDA, New Delhi; Available at other locations too</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;<span class="m_4515951508593312989gmail-tel m_4515951508593312989gmail-left m_4515951508593312989gmail-res-tel">+91 8767121212</span></p></div><p><span class="m_4515951508593312989gmail-tel m_4515951508593312989gmail-left m_4515951508593312989gmail-res-tel"><strong>Pay</strong> INR&nbsp;</span>500 for two people (approx.)&nbsp;</p></div><p>Explore<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BurgerSinghIndia/" target="_blank"> Burger Singh</a></p><div class="tiled-gallery type-rectangular" data-original-width="748" data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:101234944,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/myfoodproject.org\/2017\/01\/13\/burgers-to-satisfy-the-indian-in-you-find-out-how\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:101234944}"><div class="gallery-row" data-original-width="748" data-original-height="282"><div class="gallery-group images-1" data-original-width="374" data-original-height="282"><div class="tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large">&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>
