3842	Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP & Here’s Everything We Tried	<p>We have loved Smoke House Delhi in Hauz Khas, Vasant Kunj, Saket and CyberHub, and of course, there’s nothing like a taste of the familiar in a central location like Connaught Place. The ambience of the spot is consistent with the other outlets but also grants you a sneak-peek into the older world that CP was than what it is now.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Smoke-House-Deli-Connaught-Place-08.jpg"><img title = "Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3844" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Smoke-House-Deli-Connaught-Place-08.jpg" alt = "new delhi italian European continental connaught place   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Smoke-House-Deli-Connaught-Place-08.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Smoke-House-Deli-Connaught-Place-08-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Smoke-House-Deli-Connaught-Place-08-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Smoke House Delhi</strong></em></p><p>Still doing a very European menu, Smoke House Deli keeps on giving. The spot has opened right next to Croma in the Odeon Complex and the small entry section opens up into a large hall-like area that reminds one of an old-world coffee house.</p><p>The entry area has high tables next to the bar and deli, and the hall area is the main restaurant, the walls of which have been embellished with graffiti, spray-paint art and doodles around the theme of Connaught Place and its history.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>We picked one of the side table in the main hall, but we believe that the elevated area at the end of the restaurant gives a nice view of the entire place and is nicely lit up for you to have a quiet romantic dinner.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_201446.jpg"><img title = "Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3845" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_201446.jpg" alt = "new delhi italian European continental connaught place   new delhi italian European continental connaught place   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_201446.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_201446-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_201446-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The <strong>Melon Kiwi Lemonade</strong> or the Mojito is a great pairing to wash down all those fresh greens or the creamy pastas. You can also get a juice or coke to keep it simple.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>We could go on and on about the various starters and mains, but we will restrict ourselves to the good bits. The <strong>Chicken Noodle Soup</strong> is excellent and comes with crispy noodles, chicken, mushrooms, herbs and spices in a bowl and a broth that you can pour out. The <strong>Wild Mushroom Soup</strong> is a perfect accompaniment with all the bread and the heat of the pepper makes it a great comfort meal.</p><p>The salads were just right in our opinion. The <strong>Californian Oranges and Grapes with the Passion Fruit Dressing</strong> has the right balance of sweet and savoury (from the goat cheese). We also tried the <strong>Grape and Toasted Chia Seeds with Fig Dressing</strong>, but it was a tad too sweet.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_211809.jpg"><img title = "Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3846" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_211809.jpg" alt = "new delhi italian European continental connaught place   new delhi italian European continental connaught place   new delhi italian European continental connaught place   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_211809.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_211809-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_211809-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We recommend you dive right into the <strong>Wild Mushroom Risotto</strong> or the <strong>My Boss’s Style Spaghetti Aglio Olio</strong>. The pastas are al dente, and the <strong>Lamb and Horseradish Burger</strong> is the epitome of juicy. No really, we had to get another plate.</p><p>The <strong>Hazelnut Mousse</strong> is a perfect end to this gluttonous meal, if we may.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_214442.jpg"><img title = "Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  Smoke House Deli Is Now Open In CP &amp; Here’s Everything We Tried  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3847" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_214442.jpg" alt = "new delhi italian European continental connaught place   new delhi italian European continental connaught place   new delhi italian European continental connaught place   new delhi italian European continental connaught place   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_214442.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_214442-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161019_214442-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We haven&#8217;t tried any of the alcohol yet, so the jury is out on that. The <strong>flourless chocolate cake</strong> was slightly gelatinous. The<strong> cheesecake</strong> is drier than usual, but the blueberry compote it comes with, is stellar.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>We hope you try out the new Smoke House and we can assure you that we’re dropping back in during the day to try the sandwiches from the deli. See you there?</p><p>Drop in at Ground Floor, Odeon, D Block, Connaught Place.
