7404	Attack The Soup Of Samurai & Black Sesame Macaroon On Megu’s New Menu	<p><strong>Salt &amp; Sandals</strong> are taking a trip to japan and we got a tiny bite of it through the new menu at Megu New Delhi:</p><p>Just when the plans for Japan were getting finalised, a trip to Megu New Delhi lifted our senses.&nbsp;The Leela Palace Chanakyapuri&nbsp;is located within the near reaches of the diplomatic enclave. Their Japanese restaurant, Megu has been ruling the roost for quite some time and we tell you why.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Impressed Us At Megu?</strong></h4><p>The clean cut serene ambience starts off your gastronomic journey. With the whole restaurant covered with depictions of old&nbsp;Japanese&nbsp;culture, our journey to the land of the rising sun had started already. There are old Kimono silks on the walls and origami decorations at the Sushi bar. Winters are a time of celebrations in Japan and the new winter menu showcases that. There are a plethora of root vegetables and cold water seafood on offer.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Appetisers</strong></h4><p>The appetisers included <strong>Hokkaido King Crab with Ikura</strong>. The sweet flavours of the steamed crab combine with the <strong>Soya Salmon Roe.</strong> Each roe explodes with flavours of sea and nuttiness. <strong>Nanohana</strong> is the next appetiser and it consists of Japanese Rapeseed plant cooked in a broth. The pungent taste of the rapeseed plant is similar to that of mustard and is something that all Bengalis will enjoy.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Beautiful Sushi &amp; Sashimi Platter</strong></h4><p>A glass of <strong>cold sake</strong> down, the&nbsp;Sushi&nbsp;and Sashimi platter looked too beautiful to disturb. The <strong>Blue Fin tuna</strong> stood out with its bright red colour while the <strong>Peony shrimp</strong> impresses with its sweet flavour. The <strong>Miso Chicken roll</strong> is the Chef’s grandfather’s old recipe. We combine it with some avocado and fresh ground wasabi. One thing to notice is the seamless use of modern ingredients and cooking styles to the traditional Japanese food to twist it to mouth-watering levels.</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNVtFvzm87c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Let’s come to the&nbsp;<strong>Soup&nbsp;of Samurai</strong> now. The <strong>Zoni soup</strong> is derived out of vegetables along with yuzu, dashi and soy. It is further enriched with braised duck and a sticky, chewy mochi rice cake. Japanese soups are supposed to be slurped right from the bowl and this is what we do. The warm flavours on a cold wintery afternoon are a blessing.</p><p>The mains consist of two fishes, one is a <strong>Chilean Sea Bass</strong> and the other is a <strong>Black Cod</strong>. The <strong>Chilean Bass</strong> is flavoured with a sweet soy sauce. The Daikon pickle and ginger root add a few more layers of sweetness&nbsp;to it. The <strong>Black Cod</strong>&nbsp;is cooked with a dashi sauce and tofu balancing out the sweet and salty.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Surprising Desserts</strong></h4><p>Well, the Bengali in me can never be too impressed by&nbsp;sweets&nbsp;of another area but this is where Megu surprises me again.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Black Sesame Macaroon</strong>, the <strong>Yuzu lemon tart</strong> and <strong>wasabi flavoured Red Velvet</strong> showcased the genius creativity of the team at Megu. Some green tea to wash off the effects of the Sake and we were set for the day. Do try out Megu for some premium quality Japanese.</p><p><strong>Head to&nbsp;</strong>Africa Avenue, Chanakyapuri, Diplomatic Enclave, New Delhi, Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at&nbsp;</strong>011 39331360</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>This article first appeared on<a href="http://saltandsandals.com/new-menu-megu-leela-palace-chanakyapuri/" target="_blank"> Salt &amp; Sandals by Sudipto De</a>.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
