It is a perfect blend of street and class. On one side you find tall chairs and tables most suitable for a group hangout and the other side is paradisiacal for a date or some alone time. The variety of food in the menu is impeccable. There is something for everyone. The range varies from a basic scrumptious <strong>burger</strong> to exquisite <strong>salads</strong> and <strong>bruschettas</strong>. The <strong>Chicken Tikka Sandwich</strong> and the pitcher of <strong>Peach Ice Tea</strong> ordered was served in an appealing manner setting the mood right.The chicken was zesty and perfectly cooked, and the ice tea as refreshing and nectarous as it can be. Not only does it offers appetising food for the vegetarians, but the choices for a non-vegetarians like me is mouth watering. They have it all&#8211;from chicken to fish and lamb to pork.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>The ambience is ideal for a perfect meal, not too loud not too quiet. The choice of music being played is splendid and soulful. And if this was not enough to impress, there is a spotless huge bookshelf to your left with an admirable collection of books which you are free to enjoy with a tempting <strong>hot chocolate brownie</strong> or just coffee. It also serves for the diet conscious foodies with enticing <strong>salads</strong> and <strong>yoghurt smoothies</strong>. The desserts make your eyeballs roll and you can&#8217;t stop yourself from having one.</p><p>You don&#8217;t always have to pay a huge price for something good. The best part about Rico’s is it offers so much at a really reasonable and affordable price. This being one of the reasons why it has become such a crowd-pleasing and sought after hangout places amongst the campus joints.
