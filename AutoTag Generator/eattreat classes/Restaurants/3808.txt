3808	Khan Chacha Is Now Open In One Horizon Centre, Gurgaon!	<p>One Horizon Centre is soon going to become one of the hottest food spots in Gurgaon! After Caffe Tonino and L’Opera, it was time we got some good kebabs on this road and Khan Chacha came to  rescue.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>While the original Khan Chacha in Khan Market has a special place in our hearts, travelling that far from Gurgaon is no easy task and Delhi’s traffic does us no favours. Everyone living on Golf Course Road (and G-town) can now rejoice with an opening so close to home, it’s a stone’s throw away. This is the 6th branch for Khan Chacha and they are going strong will plans to open more (we hear Moti Bagh might be next)!</p><p>So, head over to this latest opening for mouth-watering kebabs.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Take a peek inside the kitchen to see the intriguing process of cooking kebabs on a coal grill with limited space (Hats off to the chefs!).</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Khan Chacha</strong></em></p>
