7875	My Bar, TC Restaurant, Farzi Cafe & 21 Rooftops In CP Are Sealed Now Until Further Notice	<p>The recent years have seen the coming of new and fabulous rooftop restaurants in Connaught Place. CP is surely the most popular hub for people of all age groups, and restaurateurs keep coming up with extensions to their existing establishments on the first floor to cater to the huge crowds that come a crashing on weekends. But the recent cave-in at the iconic food and shopping hub may lead to the shutting down of all of these commercial establishments and rooftop restaurants in CP.</p><p><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/ndmc-seals-rooftop-sections-of-21-restaurants-in-cp-after-building-collapse/story-IjROknyuQUEBBESBHEQY9K.html" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s closing:&nbsp;</a><strong>My Bar Headquarters</strong>, <strong>Warehouse Cafe</strong>, <strong>The Vault Cafe</strong>, <strong>Kinbuck-2</strong> and<strong> Kitchen Bar</strong>, <strong>Lord of the Drinks</strong>, <strong>Open House Cafe</strong>, <strong>Jungle Jamboree</strong>, <strong>Boombox Cafe</strong>, <strong>Farzi Cafe</strong>, <strong>House of Commons</strong>, <strong>Hotel Palace Heights</strong>, <strong>Office Canteen Bar</strong>, <strong>Luggage Room</strong>, <strong>Cafe OMG</strong>, <strong>Unplugged Courtyard</strong>, <strong>Barbeque Nation</strong>, <strong>TC Bar &amp; Restaurant</strong>, <strong>Teddy Boy Restaurant</strong> and <strong>The Niche Restaurant.</strong></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>The NDMC said, after the cave-in at C Block of Connaught Place on the 2nd of February, that the rooftop restaurants in the area may soon lose their licenses. Additionally, they also said that no commercial activity is permitted on the roof of this colonial arcade.</p><p>A senior NDMC official also added to this by saying that a team has been set up to survey Connaught Place and that they will be bringing to notice any commercial establishment that carries out its operations on the rooftop. This will be followed by getting their licenses cancelled since it is not permissible to operate there.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Solutions</strong></h4><p>The New Delhi Municipal Council is also going to ask these commercial establishments that operate out of the first floor to use low-power gen-sets and water tanks which have been adding a huge strain to the ageing rooftops.</p><p>They’ve asked the shops and establishments to use inverters for the five minutes that it takes to switch from the first circuit to the other. Since there’s no power shortage, they don’t really require high-power generators. They’re even trying to do away with the small lapses in time by bringing an automatic switching of circuits. The council has also promised to ensure 24&#215;7 water supply to shops and other establishments.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Next Steps</strong></h4><p>This may sound like music to many ears, but we’re not sure how the restaurateurs and owners of other establishments might feel if their business is at the risk of shutting down after having invested so much and being present in the area for as long as they may have.</p><p>The NDMC has already started to clear the debris from the cave-in that happened last Thursday. Personnel from the fire department, electrical and civil engineering department are also involved in it. Meanwhile, the shops on the ground floor have closed for an indefinite period of time.</p><p>The shop owners in the building say that a restaurant owner who had hired the space in December had commissioned construction work, which triggered the cave-in. NDMC’s five-member team, which includes a CPWD official, a professor of civil engineering from IIT Delhi, and a few others, will start surveying the area and damages once all the debris has been cleared.</p><p>The council feels that it was the shop owners’ responsibility to check for structural strength of the space. We’re sure that the shop owners’ agree with the urban planner and chief of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission who says, “Testing the structural stability of a building, especially when it’s a heritage one like CP, should have been done by the NDMC, which is authorised to check any new construction or related renovations in establishments in CP.”</p><p>Former commissioner of planning, DDA, Mr A K Jain says that CP, which is built with Reinforced Brick Work (RBW) is well past its shelf life, since it was built in 1930, and is closing in on about 90 years of history. RBW only has a life of about 30-40 years. The place is badly in need of reinforced cement work (RCC) for it to stay longer, since just shutting this place which is the heart of Delhi, is not really a viable option.</p><p><strong><em>Read the full story <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-cp-building-collapse-rooftop-restaurants-might-lose-licences-post-collapse/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></strong></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
