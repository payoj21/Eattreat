4821	Taj Palace, Meridien & More: 3 Newly Opened Luxurious Restaurants In Delhi	<p>Every restaurant opening in Delhi is met with excitement and enthusiasm because despite having a plethora of options to dine, its never enough!

Classic North Indian food served with a modern touch, India Bistro is winning us with their galouti and kakori kebabs.
