7158	Noshi From Yum Yum Cha Delivers Delicious Asian Food To Your Doorstep	<p>Noshi, the Asian food delivery branch of the beloved restaurant chain&nbsp;<a href="http://saltandsandals.com/press-conference-held-by-asian-hawkers-market-at-sampan-the-suryaa-hotel-on-9th-october-2015/">Yum Yum Cha</a>, is another feather in the cap of Mr. Varun Tuli. He is the force behind the lip smacking dim sums and sushi served at Yum Yum Tree and Yum Yum Cha.

Tiny freeze packs keep the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/california-roll-recipe.html"><strong>California rolls</strong>&nbsp;</a>at optimal temperature, and a bright red jute pouch holds additional dips and cutlery. <strong>Hot and Sour dim sums</strong> are savoury and provides an earthy aftertaste. <strong>Chicken and Chilli Oil dim sums</strong> are equally exciting, with delicate skins that melt in our mouth, bursts of chilli and vinegar, and garlic crumbs over it all. The dim sums came with three types of dips- a spicy dip, a garlic dip and a hot &amp; sweet dip, which were neatly packed in a bright red jute sack. <strong>Cucumber Blossoms â€˜Sushi&#8217;&nbsp;</strong>is different and delicious. It turned out to be the main highlight of our meal. Yes, they also churn a <strong>Banoffee sushi</strong> too for that sweet tooth.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Sushi Box</strong></h4><p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://saltandsandals.com/sushi-junction-shivalik-road-malvi-nagar/">Sushi box</a>&nbsp;consisted of<strong> Cucumber Blossom</strong> (which had cucumber, ponzu, sesame, and edible flowers), b(salmon, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado), and <strong>New Delhi</strong> (spicy tuna, coriander, tabasco). While all of them tasted delicious, the Cucumber Blossom was the major highlight of our meal. Along with these dishes, I also ordered <strong>Orangutan</strong>, a refreshing dish made with fresh oranges and kaffir lime leaves, which came in a swanky glass bottle. The <strong>Green Curry</strong> which is served with <strong>sticky rice</strong> had a distinct creaminess from the coconut that hits you like a rock as the spices tango with your taste buds. This is been followed by the<strong> Three Pepper Noodles</strong>. With add-ons of chicken, mushrooms, corn, water chestnut, peppers, and peanuts. The noodle bowl was simply spectacular- extremely flavorful, robust, and loaded with chicken and veggies.</p><p>Noshi produces some authentic Chinese, Thai and Japanese food that delights your senses without burning a hole in your pocket.</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 9810023349 &amp; 9810023359</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 1,000 for two people (approx)</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noshidelivery/" target="_blank">Noshi</a>.</p>
