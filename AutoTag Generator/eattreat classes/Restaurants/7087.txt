7087	This Restaurant Is Inside A Scrapped Plane In Ludhiana! And It’s Called Hawai Adda	<p>You read that right. A scrapped plane has been converted into a 4-part restaurant in Ludhiana!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Thanks to a Ludhiana-based entrepreneur, dining at a restaurant inside an aeroplane is now a reality. Hawai Adda is Punjab’s first aeroplane restaurant. They got their hands on a scrap aeroplane and turned it into this beautiful restaurant.</p><p>The restaurant opened only a month ago, before which it had to get many legal clearances. The Indian Express quoted a municipal official as saying that they weren’t aware, initially, that the plane would have a seating arrangement and a kitchen area. They were only informed that it was going to be for ornamental purposes. The Daily Post, too, says that one of the wings of the plane is too close to the road, and may be a potential traffic hazard.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15442329_1805532646384909_5785854422690892823_n.jpg"><img title = "This Restaurant Is Inside A Scrapped Plane In Ludhiana!
