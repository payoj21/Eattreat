There’s plenty of natural light that streams into the restaurant from the windows and the skylight ceiling above the bar during the day.</p><p>In case you like sitting near where you get alcohol, you can sit at the bar that has been specially designed with hand-painted pieces of wood arranged in a geometrical pattern. The bartenders are pretty friendly, and they’d be happy to help you choose your drink too.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>We had the <strong>Cold Mulled Wine</strong> that was just the thing for the hot, dusty afternoon. It’s flavoured with a Cointreau and has a really delicious house made spice syrup. It has also got a star anise that prettily floats on top.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><div id="attachment_4363" style="width: 857px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey.jpg"><img title = "These Gourmet Donuts From Parallel Craft Bar &amp; Kitchen Are Un-Paralleled  These Gourmet Donuts From Parallel Craft Bar &amp; Kitchen Are Un-Paralleled  "class="size-full wp-image-4363" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey.jpg" alt = "newly opened gourmet deli breakfast bar   newly opened gourmet deli breakfast bar   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funky-monkey-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Processed with VSCO with a6 preset</p></div><p>They’re the only restaurant in all of NCR that make fresh, gourmet donuts. You must try all three flavours — the<strong> Flying Pig</strong>, which is a breakfast donut and has crispy bacon and warm maple syrup on top; <strong>Bass Hog</strong>, which is topped with a creamy potato mash, and sinfully delicious pulled pork with a generous drizzle of bbq sauce; and the <strong>Funky Monkey</strong> which is a banana and toffee donut. SO good.</p><p>While you’re still gorging on these, consider trying the <strong>Spinach and Arugula salad with beetroots, candied walnuts, and caramelised goat cheese</strong> with a <strong>sherry vinaigrette dressing</strong>. You can add chicken or have it as is. It’s great and wholesome either way. Also, try their <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//hearty-soups-to-warm-your-family-dinner-time-this-winter/" target="_blank">soup</a> of the day—you will not be disappointed.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>We went there expecting that we’d be able to sample some of their litchi jello shots, but we were told that they’ve discontinued it temporarily. But that’s also not that big an issue as they have a pretty impressive list of drinks.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>So what we’re saying is that their gourmet donuts are TO DIE FOR and you absolutely need to head over here and get them as soon as possible just to see why we’re so crazy about them. We promise you, you&#8217;re going to love them so much, you&#8217;re going to want to come here whenever possible.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paralleldel/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
