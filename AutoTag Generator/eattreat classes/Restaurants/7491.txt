7491	Asian Haus Delivers All The Flavours Of Orient To Your Doorstep In Delhi	<p>We ordered in from Asian Haus the other day, just for a range in routine. We love Asian food, that’s for sure. So we all picked out some interesting dishes from their menu, and it was on its way.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Asian Haus is an Asian food delivery service that serves Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Japanese food. They started the gourmet Asian food delivery service back in September 2013.</p><p>As is with most food delivery outlets, they serve their food in plastic dishes. But, they package everything in boxes made of light corrugated cardboard to avoid spillage.</p><h4><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli.jpg"><img title = "Asian Haus Delivers All The Flavours Of Orient To Your Doorstep In Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7554" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli.jpg" alt = "spicy savoury restaurants Oriental Food Delivery Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/haus-burnt-chilli-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We ordered the <strong>Otak Otak</strong>, which is essentially banana leaf wrapped fish. These were probably the best things we had since they were so well done and the flavours from the lemongrass just hit the spot. We also got the <strong>Chargrilled Chicken Satay</strong>, which was well done, but the peanut sauce that they sent with it didn’t do justice to how a good satay dip should be.</p><p>We also got the <strong>Chicken Singaporean Noodles</strong> which wasn’t too bad, but it wasn’t anything special either. You should get the <strong>Haus Burnt Chilli Stir Fry Prawns</strong> to go with it. The prawns were well done and the flavours from the garlic and chilli make the noodles so much better.</p><p>While the Otak Otak was amazing, the <strong>Green Tea Cheesecake</strong> was the clear winner. It was soft and fresh and tasted faintly of green tea. It is just the thing to end your meal.</p><h4><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>We weren’t very happy with the <strong>Mixed Vegetables in Black Bean Sauce</strong>. It had no flavour profile. We wished they had used a little less soy sauce too.</p><h4><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay.jpg"><img title = "Asian Haus Delivers All The Flavours Of Orient To Your Doorstep In Delhi  Asian Haus Delivers All The Flavours Of Orient To Your Doorstep In Delhi  "class="alignnone wp-image-7555 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay.jpg" alt = "spicy savoury restaurants Oriental Food Delivery Category:Restaurants asian   spicy savoury restaurants Oriental Food Delivery Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chicken-chargrilled-satay-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Asian Haus could be your go-to place for some delicious Asian food, whenever you need a break from cooking.
