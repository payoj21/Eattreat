7623	Art & Food Coming Together: Everything You Have To Catch At the India Art Fair 2017	<p>We made our way over to a preview of the India Art Fair, which is just as stunning as it is every year. Art lovers are often seen coming back to the festival every year, and attending every session of the speaker&#8217;s forum and art film screening that is scheduled for the festival which is spread over a span of three days. If you&#8217;re planning to make your way to the India Art Fair 2017, here&#8217;s all the food you need to get whenever you take a break.</p><p><strong>Caara</strong> has put up a couple of stalls outside the main exhibition area that serve quick bites like the cheese fondue, and the quinoa salad, tea, and wine. They are also displaying cold pressed juices by<strong> Juice Up</strong>, and jackfruit chips that they&#8217;re producing and packaging under their own label. Word is, that they soon will expand into retail and will be selling dips and condiments.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara.jpg"><img title = "Art &amp; Food Coming Together: Everything You Have To Catch At the India Art Fair 2017  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7646" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara.jpg" alt = "restaurants pop-ups festival Category:Restaurants casual dining cafe   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caara-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>You step inside the exhibition hall and check out all the works by contemporary artists. This time around, there is a focus on art by South Asian artists more than European ones. Whenever you feel like you need to take a break and need a quiet space to step out and think about all that you&#8217;ve seen and experienced, you can head to <strong>Elma&#8217;s</strong> for their delectable display of tea cakes and pastries, small bites, refreshing drinks, and wine.</p><p>Have you ever wanted to preserve a fond memory, or let go of it? Head to Memoir Bar. On a piece of paper, write your name and a memory that you would like to preserve or let go of, and pick two emotions associated with it. Run the paper through the pasta maker to shred it, and place it in the acrylic tile shell. The volunteers will hand you cement of two colours that correspond to your emotions, and you can go crazy with patterns. it takes about 8 hours for it to dry, so you should come in the next day to check out what your tile looks like. If the whole experience was too overwhelming for you or if you&#8217;re just plain old hungry, you can pop into <strong>Smokehouse Deli&#8217;s</strong> stall next door to grab a sandwich or a panini, and you should be ok for a while.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/smokehouse.jpg"><img title = "Art &amp;
