4074	Mövenpick Is Spreading Its Wings To Gurgaon & GK!	<p>The Swiss ice cream boutique, Mövenpick is expanding and spreading to different locations in Delhi NCR. What started as a small kiosk in Saket, it now ready to be launched in GK II and DLF Galleria, Gurgaon. (Things are starting to look up for Gurgaon-wala’s, with more and more branches opening here, we can finally cut down our Delhi trips!)</p><p><b>First Things First</b></p><p>Mövenpick launched in India in 2014, it has since grown a loyal following of patrons (us included!) for the sinfully indulgent ice-cream and sorbets (their lime and lemon sorbet is to die for). Supported by the ideology of natural flavours and ingredients, their ice-creams have an explosive flavour and unbelievably smooth texture.</p><p><b>What More? </b></p><p>While the variety at Saket branch is often limited, it seems they will have a wider variety and better seating here. (Rejoice and revel, for Swiss ice-cream is finally here in G-town now!)</p><p>Explore more about Mövenpick <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moevenpickicecream.in/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Movenpick</strong></em></p>
