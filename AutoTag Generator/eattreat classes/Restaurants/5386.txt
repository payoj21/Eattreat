Here&#8217;s what they have to say about this wondrous chef&#8217;s tasting table.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>In an ever-changing dynamic culinary scene of New Delhi, here comes an iconic restaurant which will take one’s food experience to the next level. After achieving great acclaim and success in Mumbai, Massive Restaurants and Zorawar Kalra present The Masala Library by Jiggs Kalra. The first to introduce <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//masala-library-molecular-gastronomy-restaurant/">molecular gastronomy in Indian cuisine</a>, it has certainly modernised the contemporary Indian cuisine in style.</p><p>The location could not be posher as the 60-seater restaurant is located right next to the Le Meridien Hotel on Janpath road. The ostentatious décor will blow your mind as you enter the dimly lit, white and black toned area. The standards of the service are top notch and in simple words, it cannot get classier than this.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s On The Menu?</strong></h4><p>The Masala Library menu offers a variety of handpicked dishes from across the subcontinent and has a huge wine and single malt list. The best part is that much innovation and cutting edge technology has been used, but the authenticity of the flavours has not been compromised. This branch takes a step ahead from the one in Mumbai with some new introductions.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-607-1000x750.jpeg"><img title = "Masala Library By Jiggs Kalra Is What Luxury Is Made Of  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5411" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-607-1000x750.jpeg" alt = "luxury fine-dine expensive dinner chef Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-607-1000x750.jpeg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-607-1000x750-300x180.jpeg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-607-1000x750-768x460.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>One may not like<a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//expensive-restaurants-across-india-spend-big-bucks/"> chef’s tasting menus</a> at restaurants, as chefs take control of what is being served, with low portion sizes and miss matched combinations. But here, it’s recommended you choose the 19-course menu which has been crafted to perfection by Chef Saurabh Udinia and Chef Himanshu Saini with some uniquely presented delicacies from across India.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Portion Control?</strong></h4><p>Though the portion sizes are small, in the end of the 90-minute journey of the Masala Library, you&#8217;ll be quite stuffed. It’s designed in such a way that the outcome is simply perfect as the service of the course is timed with precision paired with some great wines. The servings start off with the <strong>Amouse Bouche</strong>, a faux egg which has coconut water as egg white and sphere mango pulp which takes a shape of egg yolk. After that, there is an avalanche of some beautifully conceptualised starters, <strong>Madhur Vada</strong>, <strong>Deconstructed Samosa</strong>, <strong>Curry leaf Prawns</strong> and Delicious <strong>Naga pork with black beans and bamboo shoots</strong> to name some.</p><p>The <strong>Mushroom Chai</strong> gives you an aromatic break in between and is prepared live with dehydrated mushrooms, tea leaves, sugar and truffle oil. The <strong>Galouti Pate with Sheermal</strong> leaves a burst of flavours followed by the robust<strong> Tawa Keema</strong> with bitter gourd. Frozen sticks of chatpata pink coloured anardana and cranberry juice are served as a sorbet which cleanses your palate.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Main Thing Is</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Deconstructed-Jalebi.jpg"><img title = "Masala Library By Jiggs Kalra Is What Luxury Is Made Of  Masala Library By Jiggs Kalra Is What Luxury Is Made Of  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4787" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Deconstructed-Jalebi.jpg" alt = "luxury fine-dine expensive dinner chef Category:Restaurants   luxury fine-dine expensive dinner chef Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Deconstructed-Jalebi.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Deconstructed-Jalebi-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Deconstructed-Jalebi-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The main course begins with delectable <strong>Handpulled duck with plum korma</strong> and believe us, this one is the highlight of the meal. In the mains, the <strong>Fermented dal pakodi</strong> and the <strong>Curry trio</strong> in which 3 types of Indian gravies are served with a soft lachha parantha are brought to you.</p><p>The desserts give the perfect ending to the meal. The <strong>Ashten kulfi</strong>, the grey colour of which was given by burnt and powdered banana leaf. Their signature <strong>Jalebi Caviar</strong> with rabdi foam is a much lighter version of what we usually expect from an Indian sweetmeat. The breathtaking presentation of the <strong>Levitating chocolate balls</strong> served on metal plates, rotating mid-air is not only worth a watch but also leaves a heavenly taste.</p><p>Make your reservations in advance at the Masala Library and be there as this place deserves a visit on a special occasion as it’s surely going to bowl you over.</p><p>Drop in at 21A, Janpath. Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MasalaLibrary/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://saltandsandals.com/masala-library-by-jiggs-kalra-a-phenomenal-dining-experience/" target="_blank">here</a>. </em></p>
