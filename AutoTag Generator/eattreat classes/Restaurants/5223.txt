5223	Iconic Veg Gulati On Pandara Road Is Doing Healthy Fare Now As Well	<p><b></b>Veg Gulati is a name well known all around Delhi NCR. Anyone who has grown up in the city ought to have visited Pandara Road and experienced their scrumptious North Indian fare! However, Veg Gulati is giving a whole new meaning to healthy food by adapting this health current trend to our beloved North Indian cuisine.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>An old legacy still shining, Gulati’s is just as amazing as it used to be 10 years back! A single name with two restaurants right next to each other, just to ensure the vegetarian fare remains separate is taking customer service to a whole new level. While, eating here we did not miss non-veg food even for a second!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Perfect Spot</b></h4><p>The restaurant has a small space but it’s tastefully done. Choose a booth on the left-hand side which gives you more space to move around, as compared to getting stuck in between tables on the right.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To </strong></h4><p><b>Fresh Ginger Lime Soda </b>made with fresh lime juice (not the bottled ones), infused with fresh ginger slices and coloured with fresh beetroot juice, it is as healthy as it is refreshing! If you are in the mood for something stronger, opt for <b>Pudina Jaljeera</b>. Made with fresh mint, infused with freshly ground jeera and topped with boondi, it has quite a kick.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>While we enjoyed almost everything here, a few dishes truly stood out. <b>Tandoori mushrooms</b> made us forget everything about chicken! Beautifully caramelised outside, they were filled with cheese in the centre (but we aren’t talking overloaded cheese, just a little) and truly bowled us over! The <b>dahi kebabs</b> is another stellar dish on the menu. Unlike other restaurants using high proportions of cream, they use hung curd (making it healthy for our body) giving it a slight tang, matched with saltiness and enhanced with the sweetness of raisins and cashews.</p><p>The main course will leave you mesmerised. Order <b>chaap masaledar</b>, made with 100% soya and no maida, it is nutritious. The curry has a beautiful blend of spices and very little oil. <b>Paneer Afghani</b> is another standout, the cottage cheese is absolutely delicious! Pair these curries with <b>chur chur parantha</b>, a healthier version of the Amritsari chur chur naan, it is made with whole wheat instead of plain flour. End the meal with <b>kheer</b> and you will be left awe-struck. Not too sweet, it is served in a goblet at just the right temperature. Infused with carrots and gourd, it&#8217;s like health gods blessing the match of traditional kheer and gajjar halwa. You cannot miss out on this!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The only thing we don’t like about Veg Gulati is their limited space. You will have to wait in lines before getting a table, but it is definitely worth it!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></p><p>When we think of North Indian, healthy is the last thing that comes to mind. Veg Gulati is out there changing this perception. Using topmost quality ingredients, little to no fattening cream and allowing the ingredients to shine rather than drowning them in unnecessary spices, you will leave this restaurant feeling delighted and content!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VEGGULATI/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
