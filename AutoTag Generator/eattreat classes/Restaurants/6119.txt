6119	Talk Of The Town: Taksim In Ansal Plaza Is Doing Cabanas & Chello Kebabs	<p>Ansal Plaza Delhi relaunched this year with its flagship brands, The Arena and Decathlon. With some brand new <a href="http://eattreat.in/ansal-plaza-the-cyberhub-of-south-delhi/">restaurants coming up</a>, it is going to be the next destination for food and party lovers of the city. Taksim is a new restaurant which opened a few days ago and something the first mall of New Delhi will be proud of. With its successful outlets in Guangzhou and Kathmandu, the F&amp;B brand enters the Indian Market with an elegant diner. <strong>Salt &amp; Sandals</strong> recently visited Taksim, and here&#8217;s the verdict.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>4200 square feet of space in the midst of Ansal Plaza Delhi, Taksim is brilliantly done and divided into 3 portions. The ground floor adorns a sophisticated bar which gives a feel of a chic diner. The first floor is a lounge with a DJ console and the third was our favourite, a beautifully done patio in white theme with comfortable cabanas. Overall the ambience provides a vibe for all moods.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s Great On The Menu</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">The menu boasts of having world cuisine and is quite balanced in terms of the offerings. It certainly is a step ahead of the other lounges where presentation does not matter; the food is served here in king-sized platters and bowls. Some of the dishes we would recommend from the starter section are the oriental <strong>Chicken Dimsums</strong>, <strong>Dahi Ke Sholay</strong> and <strong>Palak Patta Chaat</strong>. From the Mediterranean section one should not miss the classical, <strong>Chicken Shawarma</strong>. The <strong>Chello Kebab</strong>, the mint flavoured lamb served on a bed couscous infused rice with a topping of fried egg is a must try. The pizza lovers would love their wood fired <strong>Butter Chicken Pizza</strong> and <strong>Corn And Spinach Pizza</strong>. End your meal with the sinful range of desserts, <strong>Blueberry Cheesecake</strong> and <strong>Banoffie Pie</strong> being our favourites.</p><p>So plan your next get together, be it a family get together, a casual night out with friends or a romantic date as this place is suitable for all occasions.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of: <b>Taksim</b></em></p><p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://saltandsandals.com/restaurant-review-taksim-ansal-plaza/" target="_blank">Salt &amp; Sandals</a>.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
