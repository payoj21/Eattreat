6030	After Shutting Shop Across Delhi NCR, Nirula’s Is Making A Huge Comeback!	<p>Our beloved childhood favourite, Nirula’s seems to be back from the dead! Roughly 2 &#8211; 3 years ago, we noticed a surge of Nirula’s restaurants shutting down. The 4 outlets present in Gurgaon reduced to zero and while we had known for a while that it wasn’t doing well, it was hard to accept the downfall of a brand we grew up with. But, soon those mutton chops will be back in business.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/544425_457180384301803_1102917950_n.jpg"><img title = "After Shutting Shop Across Delhi NCR, Nirula’s Is Making A Huge Comeback!

So, when we heard Nirula’s has managed to strengthen their ground and is now coming back with expansion plans, our happiness knew no bounds! Surely, people living around the flickering branches still open, like Connaught Place wouldn&#8217;t have noticed or missed it, but anyone who saw a neighbouring outlet close down knows the pain of craving for a Nirula&#8217;s HCF at night and not being able to get it.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>So What We&#8217;re Saying Is</strong></h4><p>They are all prepped to open 5 outlets, 2 of which shall be in Gurgaon (finally!) along with Preet Vihar, Nilothi and Vasant Kunj and revamping the others making an overall number of 38 outlets city-wide. We have to say we are quite excited for this comeback. Hopefully, we will be able to reminisce and get some delicious food soon (Hello, mutton chops)!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nirulas/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Nirula&#8217;s</strong></em></p>
