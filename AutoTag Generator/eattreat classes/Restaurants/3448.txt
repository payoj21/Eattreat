Not yet open to public, we had the pleasure of trying them out during trials. Situated on a single floor, giving you the best of outdoor and indoor seating, it&#8217;s got a great combination of fusion food and drinks.  Doing justice to every ingredient and technique that is used, some dishes are the <strong>Vindaloo Pork Ribs</strong>, <strong>Barbecued Chicken on Cane</strong> and <strong>Gunpowder Chicken</strong>.</p><p>The drinks are even more interesting, giving a tingle to your taste buds. We loved the <strong>Pop Fashioned</strong> (a popcorn-infused Bourbon drink), and <strong>The Union</strong> (a vanilla vodka based, pomegranate drink). The restaurant is a grey and blue colour tone, keeping it different and yet, classy.</p><p><strong>Address:</strong> 31, 2nd Floor, DDA Shopping Complex, Aurobindo Place, Hauz Khas, New Delhi</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aurokitchenbar/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tanddav</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/13615251_300181736989866_5614533322454703312_n.jpg"><img title = "3 New Restaurants In Delhi That Are On Our Priority Checklist  3 New Restaurants In Delhi That Are On Our Priority Checklist  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3455" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/13615251_300181736989866_5614533322454703312_n.jpg" alt = "Sector 29 Gurgaon north Indian hauz khas delhi   Sector 29 Gurgaon north Indian hauz khas delhi   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/13615251_300181736989866_5614533322454703312_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/13615251_300181736989866_5614533322454703312_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/13615251_300181736989866_5614533322454703312_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tanddav/photos/a.291938511147522.1073741827.291936874481019/300181736989866/?type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank"><strong>Tanddav</strong></a></em></p><p>Tanddav is one of those places that has gotten on our list right away. It has been redone and is located where Smokey&#8217;s BBQ &amp; Grill used to be. It has a wine cellar the moment you the enter the restaurant and the pleasant music playing in the background is right up our alley. Also building on a whole nostalgic element, this place has some pretty unique food and perfect for a relaxed evening.</p><p><strong>Address</strong>: 2, VIPPS Centre, North Wing, LSC Masjid Moth, Greater Kailash-2</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tanddav/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of: <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/prankstergurgaon/photos/a.577581785783523.1073741829.522818087926560/577582175783484/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">Prankster</a></strong></em></p>
