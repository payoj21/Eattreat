They’ve planned to have a &#8216;Chawl&#8217; theme. You heard it right, they’ve done up the whole place like the <em>chawls</em> in Mumbai! Not only that, we also hear that the menu will also have dishes inspired from the local street food. The restaurant will most likely be functional by Friday, 9 September.</p><p>This will be Social’s fifth restaurant in the NCR. They already have their outlets in Hauz Khas Village, Defence Colony, Odeon in Connaught place (School-themed), and Epicuria in Nehru Place (Delhi Metro-themed). Apart from these, they’ve been opening restaurants in Mumbai and Bangalore, every couple of months. They’re known for their all-day breakfast and their eclectic take on food and drinks. We can’t wait to see all that they have in store with this one!</p>
