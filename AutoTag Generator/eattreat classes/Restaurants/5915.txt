5915	3 Cafes In Cross Point Mall That Are Perfect For Post-Work Coffee	<p>Cross Point Mall located opposite DLF Galleria is a food haven on its own. Packed with restaurants and cafes, you can find a variety of cuisines and different versions of comfort food here, making it one of the top locations in Gurgaon for everything breakfast, lunch to dinner. However, there are 3 cafes here we absolutely love that can make a trip from Delhi well worth it!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Di Ghent Cafe</strong></h4><p>An Austrian and Belgian cafe, we adore Di Ghent for its comfort food and decor! Everything here from breakfast to pasta’s and desserts will leave you awe-struck with not just flavour but also the presentation. The boulangerie is decorated just as beautifully and has a warm, comforting vibe where you can sit for hours with your friends or work while enjoying a <strong>doppio</strong>. The smashing <strong>waffles</strong> and coffee have made it our go-to place for weekday evenings!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DiGhent/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cafe Shunya</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cafe-Shunya.jpg"><img title = "3 Cafes In Cross Point Mall That Are Perfect For Post-Work Coffee  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5650" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cafe-Shunya.jpg" alt = "pizza mall gurgaon coffee Category:Snacks cafes   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cafe-Shunya.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cafe-Shunya-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cafe-Shunya-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>A relatively recent opening, <a href="http://eattreat.in/cafe-shunya-european-food/">Cafe Shunya swayed us </a>with its delicious, healthy food incorporating local Indian ingredients. An Indian twist on European comfort food has made it an ideal place to hit for all weight watchers and anyone else looking to eat healthy. Their large vegan and gluten-free variety is new to Gurgaon and a very welcome offering. We absolutely loved the<strong> french toast with creamy murabba</strong> and highly recommend it to everyone looking for something sweet! The <strong>bowl meals</strong> are just as great.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafeshunya/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fat Lulu’s Cafe &amp; Bar</strong></h4><p>Fat Lulu’s has a strong presence in Delhi with pizzerias all around the city. However, their cafe &amp; bar in Cross Point Mall takes it to new levels with introductions not available in other outlets. We particularly love their <strong>savoury waffles</strong> (<strong>pepperoni, bacon, cheese, egg and mustard</strong>, all in a waffle is food heaven on earth) and <strong>phat fish burger</strong>.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> They also offer desserts from The Bombaykery. <strong>Tiramisu jar</strong> after pizza indulgence is #Italianfoodgoals!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fatlulus/?hc_ref=SEARCH&amp;fref=nf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Di Ghent Cafe</strong></em></p>
