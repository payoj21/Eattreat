6067	The Closing Of These Awesome Restaurants Prove That 2016 Was A Truly Awful Year	<p>The year is coming to a close and with all its misgivings, 2016 has been quite a year. It only seems proper, to close the curtains on this year with a mention of all our favourite restaurants that closed down this year. We’ve had a stellar time at these places, and we’re really sad that they’re shut. But hey, Oberoi Hotel is coming back in two years!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Oberoi Hotel</strong></h4><p>The Oberoi Hotel has shut for renovation, for the next two years! Yes, the property in New Delhi has closed until April 2018.&nbsp; We miss Taipan, for being the mecca of Chinese fine dining. We also miss Travertino, probably one of the first few places to serve authentic Italian in New Delhi.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tres, Lodhi Colony</strong></h4><p>A three star vision of three people- Mrs Fatima Lobo, Chef Julia Carmen Desa and Chef Jatin Mallick, Tres stood for three worlds – delicious food, exceptional ambience, and impeccable service. Dining at Tres was an unforgettable experience for many. A menu that featured imaginative dishes with a gourmet edge, it was fine dining at its finest. Their decadent desserts will surely be missed.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<strong>Yum Yum Tree</strong></h4><p>Yum Yum Tree has been dishing out super sushis for the past 8 years in a fantastic space, the lease for which has expired. So they’re shutting down, and we couldn’t be sadder. The owner though, has stated that they will be back in a new location, in a new avatar. We can’t wait for it.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yeti, Hauz Khas</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yeti.jpg"><img title = "The Closing Of These Awesome Restaurants Prove That 2016 Was A Truly Awful Year  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6077" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yeti.jpg" alt = "sushi restaurants Category:Restaurants barbecue bar   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yeti.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yeti-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yeti-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Yeti, The Himalayan Kitchen</strong></em></p><p>Yeti brought Nepalese, Tibetan and Himalayan cuisines to South Delhi and was dearly loved for that. What we’ll miss the most about Yeti, was its charming take on Datchi&nbsp;&#8211; a large bowl of molten cheese with a choice of meat or vegetables.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Route 04, Khan Market</strong></h4><p>This iconic place will be remembered by many for years. It was the ultimate hangout place in Khan market, where you could down your beers and enjoy good music, with great food. Why 2016, Why?</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Smokey’s BBQ and Grill, Greater Kailash</strong></h4><p>Restaurateur Shiv Karan Singh’s venture, a barbeque and grill spread over two storeys in Greater Kailash has closed down. We will miss their Chilean Pork Ribs, a bit too much.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Monkey Bar, CP</strong></h4><p>A fashionable, brick-walled gastropub with a lengthy beer list and globe-trotting menu, Monkey Bar was loved by many for its funky vibe. We sure miss this hangout joint in Connaught place!</p><p>But there are some <a href="http://eattreat.in/opening-soon-restaurants-bars-2017/">newbies that you have to catch</a> in the year 2017. We hope you&#8217;re ready!</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of <strong>Yum Yum Tree</strong></em></p>
