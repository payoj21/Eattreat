7818	The Park’s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs & A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry	<p>Let’s just start by saying that we are super great fans of seafood and when it comes in the regional avatars of Kerala spices and bhut jolokia chillies, then it’s safe to say that we’ve been won over. But more on that later, since all you have to know is that the new menu at the Fire Restaurant, The Park, is all kinds of wondrous with their picks of history from across the country.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>So the Fire Restaurant, The Park is doing a special gourmet menu that has 50% of the produce completely organic and the rest is a very informed call taken via knowledge of produce and the source. They make sure that your entire menu is being sourced from the right places.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203.jpg"><img title = "The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7824" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203.jpg" alt = "restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141203-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The menu itself is a really great blend of South, North, East and West India. They have a platter readied for those looking for a quick bite without having to think too much. No matter which you pick (Veg or Non veg), you’re in for a journey through the coasts and plains of India.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>The facade of The Park, is the backdrop for the restaurant. And since we went during the day, we’d recommend sitting right next to the glass wall for a brightly lit atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>The sommelier will recommend some excellent reds and whites for you during the course of the meal. They also have soft beverages if you’re so inclined. The wines are perfectly paired, so take a breather from work and go check out this menu.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>The <strong>burrata salad</strong> with arugula is always a great way to start off a meal, but what probably stood out for us was the curry leaves tadka. Refreshing and with a tang of tomatoes, we moved on to the <strong>Thakali Poondu Rasam</strong>, with a <strong>curry leaf salsa bruschetta</strong>. If you have a cold, we’d be happy to recommend this to you, even though it wasn’t as smooth as rasams usually are.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033.jpg"><img title = "The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7821" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033.jpg" alt = "restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_135033-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The Fire Platter that came next had a mix of <strong>Assamese Bhut Jolokia Tiger Prawns</strong>, sourced from the coast of Gujarat; an <strong>Achari Chicken Tikka</strong> and a <strong>chargrilled fish kebab</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105.jpg"><img title = "The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  "class="alignnone wp-image-7822 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105.jpg" alt = "restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_141105-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>You can pick from the mains between a <strong>soft shell crab duo</strong> with a <strong>Chettinad style crab</strong>, a<strong> millet mutton khichadi</strong> with <strong>tapioca crisps</strong> and a <strong>Nadan Erachi Mutton</strong>, Kerala’s mutton tenderloin preparation. We absolutely loved the crab, which was easy to eat and not usually the fare in a landlocked city like Delhi.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050.jpg"><img title = "The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  The Park&#039;s Fire Restaurant Is Winning With Soft Shell Crabs &amp; A Fiery Bhut Jolokia Prawn Fry  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7823" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050.jpg" alt = "restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   restaurants luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants Buffet   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170121_140050-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>For vegetarians, there’s<strong> podi idlis</strong>, <strong>kale and goat cheese stuffed kulcha</strong> and <strong>broccoli fennel tikki</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But what we really look forward to gobbling up again is the <strong>Mysore Cacao Mousse</strong> that came for dessert.
