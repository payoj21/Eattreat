But they did. &#8220;Last year, we realised that pollution is at it’s worst after Diwali in Delhi, and pure and fresh air is something that people need. This year, we thought we should install air purifiers, and keeping in mind the severe smog conditions in the city, I think we will keep them throughout the winter. People need masks and air purifiers right now. Through our social media page, we are letting people know that we have air purifiers and the response we&#8217;ve been getting is very good,&#8221; Noah Barnes from The Hungry Monkey told <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/-As-Delhi-chokes-on-pollution-restaurants-serve-fresh-air/articleshow/55225005.cms" target="_blank"><em>TOI</em></a>.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hungrymonkeydelhi/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Twist</strong></h4><p>Gurgaon being one of the worst affected spots because of the concrete jungle, restaurants have now started investing in air purifiers and giving patrons a fresh breath of air. &#8221; &#8230;in a few minutes, as they settle down, they feel that they can breathe easily and then many ask about the change. A few who are allergic to pollutants notice the change immediately, thanks to the air purifiers that we have installed in our restaurant. People are very conscious (about this) now and they appreciate it when we tell them that we have air purifiers,” Randip Dhingra told <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/-As-Delhi-chokes-on-pollution-restaurants-serve-fresh-air/articleshow/55225005.cms" target="_blank"><em>TOI</em></a>.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Twistrestaurantandbar/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>La Bodega</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o.jpg"><img title = "Smog Survival Guide: Restaurants Serving Fresh Air In Delhi  Smog Survival Guide: Restaurants Serving Fresh Air In Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4290" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o.jpg" alt = "winter restaurants healthy diwali deli delhi bar   winter restaurants healthy diwali deli delhi bar   " width="847" height="847" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o-150x150.jpg 150w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o-300x300.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o-768x768.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14700918_886526674815221_5082074306312354041_o-640x640.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>La Bodega</strong></em></p><p>A Spain-themed restaurant tucked in the middle of Khan Market, La Bodega is doing it’s bit of providing pure air along with their live jazz bands.
