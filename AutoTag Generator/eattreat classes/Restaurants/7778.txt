It’s quite a fun exercise because the novel concept is making us think of Goa and all things beachy. We also have good things to say about their interiors, with its cool nautical theme of pastel blues and colourful oars.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Menu</strong></h4><p>The menu includes a bunch of really great classics such as the <strong>Takkali Kurumulagu Rasam</strong>, <strong>Mutton Sukka Egg Rolls</strong>, <strong>Appam Ishtew</strong> and <strong>Chicken Cafreal Slider</strong>. We are looking forward to trying their <strong>Gunpowder Popcorn</strong>, <strong>Goan Prawn Curry</strong> and <strong>Chicken 65 Pizza</strong>. For those looking for something truly out of the blue, the <strong>Chettinad Pizza</strong>, <strong>Coco Arrabiatta Penne</strong>, <strong>Mutton Sukka Spaghetti</strong> and more exist happily on the menu.&nbsp;</p><p>For dessert, we have our fave <strong>tender coconut ice-cream</strong> bookmarked, along with a checklist for the <strong>Rasmalai Tiramisu</strong>, <strong>Espresso Rasgulla</strong> and <strong>Chocolate Bomb</strong> with coconut surprises. And we can’t wait to say hello to the flavoured<strong> Nariyal Paani in Peach</strong> and <strong>Strawberry</strong>. We hear the<strong> Masala Chai Cold Brew</strong> is a winner!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;A-4, 3rd Foor,&nbsp;Adchini, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;011 41019668</p><p><strong>Pay</strong>&nbsp;INR 500 for two people (approx.)</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NariyalCafe/" target="_blank">Nariyal Cafe</a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:<strong> Nariyal Cafe</strong></em></p>
