6844	Is It Okay That Instagram Is Changing The Way Restaurants Are Serving Food?	<p>As soon as your food arrives when you’re dining at a restaurant, you’ve probably been guilty of clicking a picture or two of the dish in front of you just for Instagram because the food looked that great. For restaurants, the food that they serve has become a click-bait of sorts. Restaurant food trends now capitalise on how a dish looks instead of how it tastes, as <a href="http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/indian-restaurants-shifting-to-creating-dishes-that-is-instagrammable/56584955" target="_blank">this article by Economic Times </a>explores.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15972728_10154890258119813_6557324874133207247_o.jpg"><img title = "Is It Okay That Instagram Is Changing The Way Restaurants Are Serving Food?

So much so that when Taco Bell launched its ninth outlet in India, it started serving its <strong>Tacos</strong>, <strong>Chalupas</strong>, and <strong>Burritos</strong> in open plates to encourage their customers to elevate their ‘Instagram game.’</p><p>Youngsters armed with smartphones these days take photos of food to share on every possible platform where photo-sharing is an option. Whether it’s Instagram or Facebook, where it’s a lot more permanent, or Snapchat and Instastories, where the photos go away after 24 hours of them existing there, these photos are being shared everywhere.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Validation On Social Media &amp; Credibility Of Marketing</strong></h4><p>Dr. Arti, a clinical psychologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital says that this is an attention-seeking behaviour that makes people want to tell everyone about all that they do in the world, and the validation from likes and comments makes them feel good. She hopes that this social media addiction fizzles out in time, but is aware that it is the trend at the moment. On the other hand, Arvind Krishnan, MD of a leading advertising agency feels that people are more likely to listen to him than to the restaurant because people trust each other more than the brand.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Evolving Presentation Techniques</strong></h4><p>Restaurant food trends are aware of how just a little change in aesthetics can make all the difference. This trend is making restaurants make food that is camera friendly so they can increase the awareness of their brand and menu to attract customers.</p><p>Taco Bell isn’t the only one making a change in the way they present their food. Carl’s Jr. has started wrapping their burgers in such a way that one can see all the ingredients inside. Director of Cybiz Bright-Star Restaurants (the chain that owns Carl’s Jr. in India), Samira Chopra says that while taste is number one for them, they do care about how unique the product looks. If the tomatoes aren’t red enough, the lettuce does not look as crispy and fresh as it should be, or the <a href="http://eattreat.in/carls-jr-mutton-burgers-in-delhi/" target="_blank">chargrilling of the patty</a> isn’t done properly, it all stays on the web.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13892088_621015138058142_6409849459641019526_n.jpg"><img title = "Is It Okay That Instagram Is Changing The Way Restaurants Are Serving Food?

Calcutta have chefs whose sole job is to concentrate on the plating. Anjan Chatterjee, founder of Specialty Restaurants that owns both Mainland China and Oh! Calcutta says that while presentation has always been important for restaurants, it has become even more so now. The business has run on marketing by word-of-mouth, and marketing on social media is like a whispering campaign.</p><p>Instagramming has led restaurants to use molecular gastronomy even more, and so the restaurants have started adding dry ice to their dishes and drinks to create drama that is click-worthy. The pressure from keeping up with social media trends has also evolved plating techniques in the industry.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Trends Taking Away From The Core Focus</strong></h4><p>But some want to treat these trends as what they are&#8211;trends. Zorawar Kalra, owner of Pa Pa Ya, <a href="http://eattreat.in/masala-library-molecular-gastronomy-restaurant/" target="_blank">Farzi Cafe</a>, and <a href="http://eattreat.in/masala-library-jiggs-kalra-molecular/" target="_blank">Masala Library</a>, says that while one may want to create a stunning portrait with food on a plate so it can be shared on social media, if the taste and value-for-money proposition is not good, it won’t matter. Such trends could be a diversion from the core focus of restaurants.</p><p>Read the full story <a href="http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/indian-restaurants-shifting-to-creating-dishes-that-is-instagrammable/56584955" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of:<strong> Farzi Cafe</strong></em></p>
