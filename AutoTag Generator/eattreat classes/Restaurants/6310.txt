6310	PaPaYa Brings Molecular Gastronomy In Asian Fare & We Aren’t Complaining	<p><strong>Salt &amp; Sandals</strong> recently visited the newly launched PaPaYa and took us along. We were thoroughly impressed with their Asian fare and an eclectic sushi bar, to say the least.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>After a magnanimous success in Mumbai Mr. Zorawar Kalra has now opened the doors of PaPaYa, a modern Asian bistro to the capital in Select CityWalk, Delhi on its 4th floor. This place has a fine interior. A classy bar in the centre concealed by the conical cap shaped ceiling is a mood changer. The sushi bar on the other hand was enticing. Mr Kalra’s dynamic mind and executive Chef Sahil Singh’s culinary skills has taken the Asian cuisine to the next level. This restaurant uses molecular gastronomy to present you with the best Asian fusion cuisine in town. Their efforts are undoubtedly visible on the platter.</p><p>Cocktails like<strong> Roti sour mai</strong> served with a candy floss is prepared with egg whites and vodka as a base will give you a bliss. <strong>Bito-no-ne-chado</strong> where bito is for beetroot and chado is for chai (tea) is a tangy one. All the cocktails and mocktails with their innovation and refreshing flavour will sooth your day and relax your evenings.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s On The Menu?</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15585006_247493252338309_3500746858763626141_o.jpg"><img title = "PaPaYa Brings Molecular Gastronomy In Asian Fare &amp; We Aren&#039;t Complaining  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6344" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15585006_247493252338309_3500746858763626141_o.jpg" alt = "sushi new in town Chinese Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15585006_247493252338309_3500746858763626141_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15585006_247493252338309_3500746858763626141_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15585006_247493252338309_3500746858763626141_o-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15585006_247493252338309_3500746858763626141_o-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Photo Courtesy Of: PaPaYa</p><p>Moving on to food, as we know Asian cuisine without sushi is like candy without sugar so here sushi is served on a wooden matrix found to be one of the most delectable and creative sushis and nigris. The sushi bar serves both veg and non-veg. <strong>Grilled chicken and avocado tacos</strong> which are made using the gyoza sheet shells and ching mai relish grated cheese is heaven for taco lovers. Their<strong> veg taco</strong> is a delight for vegans. <strong>Soft shell crab buns</strong> is the one stealing the show. The buns used in it are honey glazed and the taste of it along with sriracha tartar sauce will take your palates to another level. <strong>Hoisin chilli duck dogs</strong> are the best you will ever have. In this the duck is braised and is mixed with hoisin sauce, chillies, bonito flakes and bubuarre for the filling. Dishes like <strong>Tuna Tataki pizza</strong>, <strong>Crab and scallop jiaozi</strong> which is an Asian ravioli are worth spending a dime for. This place is a paradise for the Asian cuisine lovers and should be the next on their bucket list.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PaPaYaAsianSCW/" target="_blank">PaPaYa</a></p><p>This article was originally published on <a href="http://saltandsandals.com/papaya-modern-asian-bistro-select-citywalk-saket/" target="_blank">Salt &amp; Sandals</a>.</p>
