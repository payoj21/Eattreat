We recommend the <strong>Schezuan Spicy Chicken</strong>,  <strong>Hauz Chilli Fish with Cassie</strong>,  and the <strong>Firecracker Chicken</strong> for starters. For the main course, you’ve got to try the <strong>Cantonese Chicken</strong>,  <strong>Kung Pao Chicken</strong>, <strong> Mama Mutton with Roti</strong>, <strong>Khao Suey</strong> and <strong>Thai Curry Box</strong>.  The best part was that the <strong>Thai Curry Box</strong> and <strong>Khao Suey</strong> were super well packed and easy to set up. No messed up tables and that really speaks volumes of their service. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>We wish we could go check the fare out in a restaurant as well!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>So you need to host a party and you’re confused how to cook a meal for 20, perhaps 50, don’t worry.  Asian Haus has got it covered for you.
