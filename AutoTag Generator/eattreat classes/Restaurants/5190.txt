5190	Did You Know The Spaghetti Carbonara Has Really Tumultuous Origins?	<p>Who doesn’t love a good spaghetti carbonara? It’s cheesy, it’s got bacon, and it’s got spaghetti! Whether you’re stuffing yourself with spaghetti carbonara on a chilly winter night, or dishing it out to impress your friends at a brunch – we’re sure you dig it just as much as we do.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>We’ll take a moment here for the uninitiated, spaghetti carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, cheese (Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), bacon and black pepper.</p><p>Now, for the initiated. Did you know that this dish dates to sometime around the 20<sup>th</sup> century? We’ve got some facts and folklores about the beloved carbonara’s origins.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Carbonara Originates From The Appenine Mountains Of Abruzzo</strong></h4><p>Most of the theories about the carbonara are anecdotal. Some of them point to the Appenine mountains of the Abruzzo, where the dish seems to have been cooked by woodcutters who made charcoal for fuel. They would cook the dish using penne rather than spaghetti, as it is easier to toss penne with eggs and cheese.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>It Was The Staple Fare Of Coal Miners</strong></h4><p>Other more obvious theories, talk of the dish being eaten by coal workers (The meaning of <i>alla carbonara</i> is coal worker’s style) and that the use of coarsely ground black pepper resembles coal flakes.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>It Was Learned By The Romans During World War II</strong></h4><p>There is also a theory which says that in the province of Ciociaria, halfway between Rome and Benevento, pasta was seasoned Neapolitan style with eggs, lard and pecorino cheese. During the German occupation of Rome during WW II, many middle-class families dispersed from Rome to this region to escape, and learned about this dish. After the war, Roman cuisine became very popular throughout Italy, and the carbonara was a prime example.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>It Came From The Famous Restaurant In Rome &#8211; La Carbonara</strong></h4><p>Another tale talks of how the famous restaurant in Rome, La Carbonara, was named after its speciality. Though the restaurant has been open in Rome since early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and does have carbonara on its menu, the restaurant itself denies any such connection and tells us the name came about for other reasons.</p><p>Whatever Carbonara’s origins may be, one thing is for sure – we are glad it exists! It is a fairly simple dish to prepare, so you needn’t be cooking up a storm in your kitchen. You can serve it with some Bruschetta on the side, or some roasted Asparagus. You could serve it by itself too, it’s a winning dish. ☺</p><p>You can try some in Delhi <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//5-restaurants-dinner-food-delhi-winter/">here</a>.</p>
