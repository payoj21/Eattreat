8534	Bread, Cakes & Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas	<p>If you’ve been here regularly, you’d know how much we love bakeries, and even more so when they’re cute (well, which one isn’t?). We stumbled upon this lovely bakery in Hauz Khas that’s got these pretty, almost Parisian interiors, and makes desserts and bread to die for—fresh, day after day! Here are the top 5 things we loved from Cravity, the newly opened café in Hauz Khas.</p><h4><strong>1. Bread</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM.jpeg"><img title = "Bread, Cakes &amp; Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8599" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM.jpeg" alt = "sweet savoury Hauz Khas dessert Category:Bakery bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM.jpeg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM-300x180.jpeg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM-768x460.jpeg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM-825x493.jpeg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM-410x246.jpeg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WhatsApp-Image-2017-02-22-at-5.51.00-PM-150x90.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They bake their bread, fresh every single day! At the moment they have 6 different varieties including whole wheat, rye, brown, focaccia, sun dried tomato and olive focaccia, and multigrain bread. You can just pop in for a loaf (or few) each day! What’s more is that you can see the bread being prepared in the kitchen. Cravity also makes these delicious burgers that use these ultra soft brioche buns that are also made in-house. At the moment the brioche buns aren’t for sale, but we sure do hope that they will!</p><h4><strong>2. Khao Suey</strong></h4><p>They’ve got the Burmese Khao Suey on their menu and it’s exactly as delicious as you expect it to be. All the toppings like fried onion and garlic, peanuts, etc. come in small bowls so you can use them to your discretion. It definitely spells out comfort food for us.</p><h4><strong>3. Macarons</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity.jpg"><img title = "Bread, Cakes &amp; Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas  Bread, Cakes &amp; Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8602" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury Hauz Khas dessert Category:Bakery bakery   sweet savoury Hauz Khas dessert Category:Bakery bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cravity-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They do macarons right. No wonder that their special Wasabi Macarons were such a hit at the Asian Hawker’s Market this edition. They’ve got 6 flavours and we love all of them! They’ve got the classic Chocolate, Lemon, and Raspberry; and they’ve got the Fig and Cinnamon, the Beurre Salle (salted caramel flavoured), and the Laphroaig (single malt flavoured) macarons. You won’t be able to stop at just one!</p><h4><strong>4. Hot Chocolate</strong></h4><p>Their Hot Chocolate is so nice and thick, it feels like you’re straight up drinking dark chocolate ganache. You’ve got to get a mugful of this when you’re feeling low&nbsp;because it does feel like a warm hug. You may want to start slow because of how hot it is. They also give you a tiny piece of dark chocolate or a biscotti to go with your mug.</p><h4><strong>5. Desserts</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss.jpg"><img title = "Bread, Cakes &amp; Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas  Bread, Cakes &amp; Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas  Bread, Cakes &amp; Hot Chocolate: 5 Things To Try At Cravity, The New Café In Hauz Khas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8600" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss.jpg" alt = "sweet savoury Hauz Khas dessert Category:Bakery bakery   sweet savoury Hauz Khas dessert Category:Bakery bakery   sweet savoury Hauz Khas dessert Category:Bakery bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tender-kiss-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They serve a bunch of desserts but we love Tender Kiss. It is a blend of chocolate and raspberry with an almond sponge, and it is oh-so-good! You must also grab a Banana and Walnut or Blueberry Muffin on your way if you’re here just to pick up a loaf of bread.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> A 15A/1, Hauz Khas, New Delhi</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Say hello at</strong>&nbsp;098997 97979</span></p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 350 for two people (approx)</p><p>Order <a href="http://cravity.xyz/order-online" target="_blank">online</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cravityofficial/" target="_blank">Cravity</a></p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Cravity</strong></em></p>
