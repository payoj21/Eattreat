It was from this observation that they brought Café Delhi Heights to town. They wanted to give people a brand of eateries that became a part of our daily lives and one that became synonymous with the café culture that exists in Delhi NCR.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Cautious Expansion Plans</strong></h4><p>They say that they go through rigorous research before expanding into a new area just to make sure that they’re at the right location to reach their target customers. They don’t want to open new outlets to just increase their numbers, they also want to make sure that it’s going to be a profitable venture.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Best Performing Outlet</strong></h4><p>The Batra family says that all their cafés perform well depending on their sizes. What matters more to them isn’t the volumes or numbers, but the number of return customers and the number of people that walk into their café. Their first outlet (the one in Crosspoint Mall) works best according to this parameter.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On What Differentiates Café Delhi Heights From The Others</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/waffles.jpg"><img title = "Family Restaurant Café Delhi Heights Is Opening 11 New Outlets In 2017  Family Restaurant Café Delhi Heights Is Opening 11 New Outlets In 2017  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4377" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/waffles.jpg" alt = "    " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/waffles.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/waffles-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/waffles-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The café is a casual dining family restaurant and focuses on comfort food. It caters to the palates of the person who moves in Delhi’s social circles, as well as that of the inbound traveller. They serve dishes from the European cuisine, but with a modern Delhi twist on it. They have something for everyone.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Pricing Strategies</strong></h4><p>They’re a purely value for money café that caters to people of most (if not all) economic backgrounds in the country. The portions are generous and in accordance to the ambience and the price points.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Expansion Plans</strong></h4><p>The family says that they like to keep it simple and are looking at a very organized growth. By 2017, they want to be able to have 20 outlets under their wing in Delhi NCR and Mumbai. They’re not looking for franchises, and want to be a purely self-owned outlet.</p><p>Read the full story <a href="http://www.indiaretailing.com/2016/11/08/food/food-service/cafe-delhi-heights-to-open-11-more-outlets-by-2017-end-franchising-not-on-the-cards-owner/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafedelhiheights/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Café Delhi Heights</strong></em></p>
