6765	Bali, Bologna & Beirut: Andrea’s Eatery Brings The World’s Best To Our Table	<p>Andrea Pauro’s Amici has been around for a while and has been delivering happy pizzas to your tables. But the newest feather on this well-travelled gourmand’s hat is this tiny eatery, which has emerged in the place of Amici at <a href="http://eattreat.in/andreas-eatery-travel-restaurant/">Select CityWalk &#8211; Andrea&#8217;s Eatery</a>. And all we can say is that our collective minds exploded after trying out this restaurant and this journey of food around the world.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Serving giant portions of Asian, Thai, Vietnamese, Italian, Lebanese and so much more, Andrea’s Eatery tells a story of a man who has travelled all over the world and brought you the choicest morsels from every country. The dark teal and emerald interiors and exteriors make the spot stand out in the busy mall and we loved that just the look of it were inviting walk-ins on a lazy Tuesday morning.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>The best place to sit here is is right next to the glass facade or outside. If you’re inside, the glass breaks the noise from the mall and gives you a quaint but brightly lit spot to sit and people-watch. If you miss the old Amici, then sitting at the same spot outside may give you some nostalgia to hold on to.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>We tried the <strong>Siam Watermelon Cooler</strong> that is everything you need with their filling meal bowls. They also have a very popular <strong>Spicy Bloody Guava</strong> that we intend to get our hands on.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_130023.jpg"><img title = "Bali, Bologna &amp; Beirut: Andrea&#039;s Eatery Brings The World&#039;s Best To Our Table  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6785" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_130023.jpg" alt = "vietnamese Thai saket lebanese italian Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_130023.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_130023-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_130023-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_130023-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The chef spoilt us silly with the amazing Asian bites since we have a penchant for it. But we will equally recommend the meal bowls and the pizza that are classic of food around the world. The <strong>Silken Tofu</strong> from the <strong>Viet Kong Banh Trang Rolls</strong> section is a great start to this soiree, albeit it being vegetarian. For the non veg sticklers, we’d recommend the pungent <strong>Lebanese Shish Taouk</strong>, <strong>Echo Beach Satay</strong> and the <strong>Dive Boat Fish Cake</strong> (though that fishy aftertaste seemed missing in this one). The peanut sauce is definitely the star, when it comes to their many dips and condiments.</p><p>If you want to move towards the western world, we had an absolutely gala time with the bruschetta platter, that had a mix of <strong>Parma Ham</strong>, <strong>Salmon</strong>, <strong>Maple Pears</strong>, <strong>Avocados</strong> and a mix of various cheeses: goat, mozzarella, and cream cheese. The soft taco that came with <strong>Fajita Chicken</strong> is a tummy filler, so be careful of how many you order.</p><p>From the salad section we had a ball with the<strong> Super Salad</strong>. The seeds, berries, leaves and radishes producing a medley of their own, the honey-balsamic dressing was something completely else. And just FYI, the <strong>Gado Gado salad</strong> from Bali will be something that you’ve never tried before, and had a splash of our favourite aforementioned peanut sauce.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_131655.jpg"><img title = "Bali, Bologna &amp; Beirut: Andrea&#039;s Eatery Brings The World&#039;s Best To Our Table  Bali, Bologna &amp; Beirut: Andrea&#039;s Eatery Brings The World&#039;s Best To Our Table  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6786" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_131655.jpg" alt = "vietnamese Thai saket lebanese italian Category:Restaurants asian   vietnamese Thai saket lebanese italian Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_131655.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_131655-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_131655-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170105_131655-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Now, this is the section you must look out for. The Superbowls are fantastic if you want a full meal all by yourself. We took spoonfuls of the <strong>Caramel Pork</strong> and the <strong>Chicken Krapaw</strong> from Thailand and we have to say, we’re going back for this. The pizzas will add their own pizzaz to the table but if we had to pick one, it’d be the <strong>The Verde</strong>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>Usually what stands out for us, seemed a little off here, which is the dessert. We tried the <strong>Berrilla Delight</strong> and the outside was a bit gelatinous while the inside being too dry. Would give this one a pass, but the gelato section looks amazing.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Andrea’s Eatery, when you visit the mall, is perfect for a sit-down lunch or a quick face-stuffing with food around the world. We’re heading here on our off days and hoping to see you there gobbling up the superbowl.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Shop 48A-51, First Floor, District Centre, Saket,</p><p><strong>Say hello at </strong>+91 8588823873</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 2,000 for two</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AndreasEatery/">Andrea’s Eatery</a></p><p><i>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Kasturi Roy</strong></i></p>
