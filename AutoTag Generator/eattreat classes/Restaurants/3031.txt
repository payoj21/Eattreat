3031	The New Chi Asian Cookhouse At Mall Of India Has Chi Chewees & Chindian!	<p>Chi Asian Cookhouse brings the best of Pan-Asian flavours to you in the most unique&nbsp;of ways. Their third outlet in the NCR, Chi strives to set the theme and some portions of the menu according to the area that they open their outlet. So,&nbsp;Asian food in Noida, here we are.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Chi at Mall of India has a hawker’s market-themed decor and menu, which is reflected in the basket-weave patterns on the wall, the signboards of the various famous markets in Southeast Asia, the dumpling basket lanterns, the table mats, and the open façade of the restaurant— all replicating the look and feel of a marketplace in the best way possible.</p><p>They’ve included a ‘Chindian’ menu here, seeing how much the good folks in Noida love their Honey Glazed Wings and Honey-Chilli Potatoes.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cherry Picked</strong></h4><p>There’s ample seating closer to the open façade, and it&#8217;s perfect for you to relax with friends and family. There’s a lot of natural light that streams into the restaurant during the day&nbsp;since it is closer to the atrium in the mall. You can sit back and enjoy your food and not feel the hours slip away.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Interior-1-Chi-Asian-Cookhouse-MOI.jpg"><img title = "The New Chi Asian Cookhouse At Mall Of India Has Chi Chewees &amp; Chindian!

They come in a variety of flavours—our favorites were the Apple Basil, Green Apple Mint, and Watermelon Kafir ones. There are these tiny pieces of jelly inside the drink that you can chew on while drinking it, that give it its name.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>Where do we even begin? The Chiang Mai Glass Noodle Soup, Goi salad, Bak Chor Mee, Butter Garlic Prawns, Chicken Kimbap, the Honey-Chilli Potatoes, and Honey Glazed Wings were all things we absolutely loved! Even though we were stuffed by the end of it all, we got the most amazing desserts that you just cannot miss if you’re at Chi.</p><p>You shouldn’t think twice before ordering the Coconut Pancakes (served with vanilla ice-cream and topped with caramel sauce) and the Fried Ice-Cream—which was a sweet surprise (literally) because we did not expect it to look or taste the way it did.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5856.jpg"><img title = "The New Chi Asian Cookhouse At Mall Of India Has Chi Chewees &amp; Chindian!

The Samui Mushroom &amp; Broccoli Satay was a tad bland for our taste as well.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>All in all, Chi Asian Cookhouse is a restaurant that you will find yourself going to, over and over again—specially if you’re someone who’s trying Asian fare for the first time; or even if you’re someone who likes to experiment with food. We feel that Chi definitely checks off all the boxes when it comes to service and hospitality as well.</p><p>Explore Chi Asian Cookhouse <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chiasiancookhouse/?fref=ts">here</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Pictures courtesy of:</strong> Chi Asian Cookhouse</em></p>
