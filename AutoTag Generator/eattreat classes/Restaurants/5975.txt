5975	Love Punjabi Food? Punjab Grill Goes To Kolkata & 3 Other Continents	<p>Punjab Grill made quite a few marks on the map in 2016 with expansion abroad, cities within India and a new brand called <a href="http://eattreat.in/punjab-grill-tappa/" target="_blank">Punjab Grill Tappa</a> for small plates of Punjabi food. You would think they will be slowing down the coming year but that is the not the case. With high spirits and overwhelming response they have a robust expansion plan in place that is just as extravagant as this year’s.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>While Delhi saw the opening of Punjab Grill Tappa in Cyber Hub; Dehradun, Chennai and Hyderabad opened doors to the first Punjab Grill restaurant in 2016. However, thats not all, their international footprint grew with outlets opening in Sri Lanka, Abu Dhabi, Bangkok, Colombo and Singapore. Punjab Grill Singapore bagged the HAPA award in 3 different categories and became the first Indian restaurant to be part of Singapore’s Michelin guide.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What’s More?</strong></h4><p>As quoted by a Lite Bite Foods executive “We are in the process of signing up at quite a few locations. They are in pipeline and at various stages of finalisation of a deal.” The brand intends to grow abroad and is working to open in 3 different continents (we wonder where?) as well as a major city in India, Kolkata. So, watch out for Punjab Grill because it seems they will soon become a brand synonymous with North Indian cuisine &amp; Punjabi food around the globe!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rangla Punjab</strong></h4><p>Punjab Grill also became one of India’s first restaurants to curate a unique Punjabi food trip called Rangla Punjab in January 2016. Connecting with patrons and members of the food industry they ventured into Ludhiana to give a taste of authentic Punjabi fare. Continuing the legacy, 2017 will see the second edition of Rangla Punjab.</p><p>Explore more about Punjab Grill <a href="https://www.facebook.com/punjabgrill.official/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
