3065	Calcutta’s First Pet-Friendly Cafe, The Love Room Is Here And How!	<p>Woof-Woof! WooHoo! Kolkata or Calcutta as we like to call it, now has a pet-friendly cafe and <a href="http://calcurator.in/home/petcafecalcutta" target="_blank">Calcurator </a>recommends it! There’s much to celebrate. The Love Room opened it’s doors to both four-legged and two-legged beings.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>The owners, Shruti and Ankush are both pet-lovers and, felt that our city needed a place where you could go for a nice meal and take your pet along. The cafe has nine resident dogs, that cuties include a Shi-Tzu, an Irish Setter, a Golden Retriever and an appropriately named Siberian Husky &#8211; Ego (you need to meet him to know why!), among others.</p><p>The Love Room has an elegantly fenced play-area for their dogs with a cute little kennel as well. The interiors are warm and welcoming as are the happy canines. Take your own pooch along, for an afternoon to hang out with this boisterous bunch and enjoy a nice nibble from their extensive menu.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/PetDogCafeKolkataCalcutta.jpeg"><img title = "Calcutta’s First Pet-Friendly Cafe, The Love Room Is Here And How!
