3539	Naturals Has A Brand New Flavour & It’s Kinda Weird	<p>Well, we walked into the GK 2 Naturals this weekend and as graciously as ever, we were offered the new flavour that they&#8217;ve introduced this season &#8211; Saunf {Fennel}. The green creamy texture piqued our curiosity quite a bit and we were quite amused to know that after-mint has now indeed taken the form of an ice cream.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-08-at-9.18.04-AM.png"><img title = "Naturals Has A Brand New Flavour &amp; It&#039;s Kinda Weird  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3547" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-08-at-9.18.04-AM.png" alt = "weird trending ice cream desserts   " width="985" height="574" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-08-at-9.18.04-AM.png 985w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-08-at-9.18.04-AM-300x175.png 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-08-at-9.18.04-AM-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px" /></a></p><p style="text-align: left;"><em>Photo Courtesy Of:<strong> Naturals</strong></em></p><p>If you&#8217;re in the market for something other than the already famed Naturals Tender Coconut, Sitaphal, Chickoo or Jackfruit, then this unique combination of fennel, milk and a hot day will be just right. While we felt that this was pure goodness in the first couple of bites, it takes some getting used to.</p><p>Moreover, this is just the right dessert post your heavy meal, giving you a wave of drowsiness in its wake. For some, the flavour might be a little bit too pungent but the bite of the flavour is quite a refreshing change for us.</p><p>You can these in scoops or half kg boxes.
