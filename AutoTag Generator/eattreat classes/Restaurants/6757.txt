6757	Chef Saby’s New Cafe Is Coming To Meherchand Market & It Looks Like A Festival!	<p>Chef Saby is opening his very new café in Meherchand Market, and we can’t get over how pretty it looks. And it&#8217;s tentatively going to called <strong>Eywa By Saby</strong>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>The café&#8217;s name is yet to be decided but it will probably be called Eywa By Saby. But, what we do know is that it’s going to be a small 20-seater place with beautiful vintage artefacts and the seating arrangement is made with distressed wood. They’ve also got a nice plush burlap couch in one corner of the area.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/16107850_10154770934034333_2059482665_o.jpg"><img title = "Chef Saby’s New Cafe Is Coming To Meherchand Market &amp; It Looks Like A Festival!
