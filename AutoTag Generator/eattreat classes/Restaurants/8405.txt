8405	The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy & A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream	<p>Launching a new menu is always a matter of excitement and of course, it brings the promise of something brand new and fabulous. The thing is, we can say all of those things about Pickwicks, The Claridges new menu. We found ourselves planted on one of their plush chairs, trying out their teatime bites and more.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>With a beautiful view of the gardens and the pretty gazeboes and sun shades, Pickwicks is perfect for a brunch or even a post afternoon lounging. With a large selection of pastas, salads, quick bites and European fare, this is probably just the place you need to head to when you want some coffee and a post lunch appetiser, that doesn’t fill you up too much.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks.jpg"><img title = "The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy &amp; A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8407" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks.jpg" alt = "restaurants new menu luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Claridges-Pickwicks-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We love all the nooks at this place but we pick a table facing the garden on a sunny afternoon. It’s quite pleasant to watch other diners from the comfortable lull of the air-conditioning.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>We had a wonderfully fragrant Bellini and the drinks menu is quite extensive, so you can pick from their options of cocktails and mocktails, as well.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>While there is a whole lot to choose from, you have to be careful of their very particular timings. While we stepped in at about 4pm, the lunch menu was already off the table. But apart from that, you can pick from a wide variety of sandwiches and casual knick knacks. The <strong>Kerala Style Spicy Fried Prawns</strong>&nbsp;come on a pretty green banana leaf and has a typical chutney that adds flavour to good measure. The<strong> Croque Monsieur</strong> is super filling and the addition of multiple cheeses makes this one a hit for us (along with the healthy portions of french fries).&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333.jpg"><img title = "The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy &amp; A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream  The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy &amp; A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8408" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333.jpg" alt = "restaurants new menu luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants   restaurants new menu luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_163333-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>You can also pick from the pasta section, and go for the <strong>Carbonara</strong> like we did. And we can tell you, there’s nothing better than bacon on a fine weekday afternoon, to make you forget your troubles. And if you’re really not that hungry and just need something to munch on while reading a book, the <strong>Chilli Cheese Toast</strong> is a good bet.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412.jpg"><img title = "The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy &amp; A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream  The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy &amp; A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream  The New Menu At Pickwicks Has Everything Cheesy &amp; A Stunning Cinnamon Ice-Cream  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8409" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412.jpg" alt = "restaurants new menu luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants   restaurants new menu luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants   restaurants new menu luxury lunch fine-dine Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170207_162412-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Of course, dessert was a fun affair with a crisp <strong>apple pie</strong> and a very unusual <strong>cinnamon ice-cream</strong>. TBH, we’re going back for that ice-cream.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>Apart from their menu being divided in terms of timings, which can be disappointing to someone who is ordering, the food is good enough for a light lunch.</p><h4><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>While we wouldn&#8217;t recommend the place for a big heavy family affair, this is really quite quaint and nice for a quick bite. So go here for the Chilli Cheese Toast and stay for the wonderful service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;The Claridges, 12, Dr. A.P.J.
