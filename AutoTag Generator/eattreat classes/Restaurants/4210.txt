4210	Inclov Arranges Dates At Popular Restaurants In Town For The Specially Abled	<p><i></i>We, Indians never actually give a thought that the differently abled also yearn for love just like you and me.  But through a new found app “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Inclov/" target="_blank">Inclov</a>” their calls for a partner are answered!  Inclov is the world&#8217;s first matchmaking app founded in 2014, focuses on people with disability, and with health disorders to find love.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>“In the process of understanding the differently-abled community better, we realised that many of their social lives are rather restricted,” says Shankar Srinivasan, Co-founder of Inclov. Initially started as an online app now IT has extended to a fully organised offline experience with the founders setting Social Spaces (also known as “happy places”) for these meet ups. So far, <strong>Hauz Khas</strong>, the <strong>Lemon Tree Hotel</strong> and <strong>Farmout Café</strong> in Gurgaon, <strong>Elliot Beach</strong> in Chennai, <strong>Prabodhan Thackeray Park </strong>in Mumbai, <strong>Kunzum Café</strong>, <strong>House 36</strong> and <strong>British Council</strong> in New Delhi have been kind enough to host them.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>These restaurants have several amenities like ramps, accessible washrooms with handles, bars, wide entries, braille signages, braille menu cards as well as sign language interpreters installed to give our unique buddies a soothing experience. These meet ups are blessed with sensitive and helpful staff, sign language interpreters and accessible venues.</p><p>About 50% of people who attend these meetups are not differently abled. Since this an all-inclusive networking platform, everyone is welcome! “When we talk about our meet ups, people generally imagine an event where we awkwardly line up men and women and try to match them. Or the typical ‘swayamvarmelas’ where everyone comes on stage to do an elevator pitch and if others are interested they can get in touch,” says Shankar. But contrary to the conception which people have,these events are real fun with many bands including Dhunsatva, speakers like Preeti Monga, poet Ajay Verma, and stand-up comic Chitra Kalyani rocking the whole preexisting  joyous and exciting atmosphere.</p><p>Having had 6 meetups so far and impacting more than 1000+ people, they are planning to take their initiative to next level by hosting 100 social spaces across India by 2017.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Inclov</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
