6472	Ever Tried The Big Chill For Vegetarian Dishes? Here Are Our Top Picks!	<p><strong>Delectable Reveries</strong> visited The Big Chill Cafe and took us along. We think The Big Chill Cafe is a timeless classic, that we simply love going back to. Read on to know why.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Good food, like every good thing in this world, is to die for. The Big Chill, plush in the high streets of Khan Market of New Delhi, is a personification of this very statement. Even in the midst of the gleaming new places, The Big Chill holds its own. Walk up the narrow flight of stairs into the dinner hall adorned by posters of some of the greatest films of all time, and you’re greeted by affable, smiling faces. The menu, flag-bearer of The Big Chill’s gorgeous spread, headlines with Alfred Hitchcock’s legendary quote from his iconic film, Birds.</p><p>If you are visiting the place for the first time, you’ll take quite some time to decide exactly what you want. You can choose to tuck into the lip smacking pizzas, or go for an incredibly well-cooked risotto. Further down the pages, you come across wide varieties of lasagne, sandwiches and more. It is marvellous to note that even in a restaurant particularly revered for its non-vegetarian fare, vegetarians have options galore to choose from, and the nosh is excellent.</p><p>After over five years of winding up at The Big Chill every time we have needed to find inspiration and cheer, here are mainstays of our orders. Each of these dishes have catered to specific moods, along with the evergreen presence of the wonderful mocktails and the legendary desserts.
