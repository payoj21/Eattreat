All of these elements for sale are limited edition designer pieces.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>They have a fun menu of Colaba cuisine which has an old Bombay charm, and European dishes and desserts accompanied by cocktails, wines and spirits.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>We began your journey by choosing from a fun Mumbai and Gujarat street food and snack menu by Chef Pawan which has farsaan and snacks which have not been served before in Delhi, cooked by experienced and talented maharajs.</p><p><img title = "Purr-fect Coastal &amp; Bambaiyya Flavours At Junglee Billee For The Seafood Enthusiasts  Purr-fect Coastal &amp; Bambaiyya Flavours At Junglee Billee For The Seafood Enthusiasts  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2526" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/6.png" alt = "theme south indian seafood restaurant drinks coastal Category:Meats   theme south indian seafood restaurant drinks coastal Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/6.png 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/6-300x180.png 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/6-768x460.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></p><p>We then experienced the robust flavours of Scion Koliwada with dishes like Koliwada chicken, Koliwada Fish, Noorani Tangri Kebab, Tandoori Surmai and Kalmi kebab. To cater to the health conscious women, they have focused on light foods, using whole wheat flour wherever possible, and using lighter oil like Pomace olive oil for cooking, light yet delicious salads with no oil citrus dressings, and lot of healthy fish and seafood dishes. Use of healthy coastal, Gomantak and Malvani ingredients like tamarind and kokum, which are hardly being used in North India.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></p><p>Walk through the gullies of Mohammad Ali Road and Bohri Mohallah while experiencing the signature dishes and if that isn&#8217;t possible, Junglee Billee has them in their menu. Special mention to Chef Pawan who took us on a food journey while making sure we did not miss out on the little details in the decor and other elements at Junglee Billee.</p><p>Explore<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JungleeBilleeDelhi/" target="_blank"> Junglee Billee here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: Ankit Mathur</em></p><p><em>This article first appeared on <strong>Breviloquent</strong></em></p>
