5945	The Delhi Tourist’s Guide To Eating Excellent Mumbai Food In 24 hours	<p>Landed in Mumbai and have just 24 hours to soak in the trendy yet traditional vibe of the city of dreams? A day is by no means enough to completely take in all that this city has to offer. But, if a taste of Mumbai food is what you seek, we’ve put together a tried and tasted (pun intended) guide to exploring the gastronomical landscape of Mumbai in a crazy short capsule of time, starting with brekkie and going on until dinner.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pav Bhaaji at Sukh Saagar For A Quick Start</strong></h4><p>You just cannot stop over at Mumbai and not have the famed <strong>pav bhaji</strong> at Sukh Sagar in Chowpatty. Cooked with dollops of butter, fresh vegetables, flavoursome spices and tonnes of sincerity, this indigenous dish is one you cannot afford to miss. Start your day with this utterly, butterly awesomeness and your entire day will be a power-packed one for sure!</p><p>Head to Marina Mansion, SVP Road, Chowpatty, Mumbai</p><p><strong>Cost for two:</strong> INR 600</p><p>Contact them on 022 23636856</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A Fishy Affair At Mahesh Lunch Home For Your Lunchtime Seafood Cravings</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malabari_Fish_Curry_Rawas.jpg"><img title = "The Delhi Tourist’s Guide To Eating Excellent Mumbai Food In 24 hours  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5992" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malabari_Fish_Curry_Rawas.jpg" alt = "Pav Bhaji mumbai fish desserts coastal Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malabari_Fish_Curry_Rawas.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malabari_Fish_Curry_Rawas-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Malabari_Fish_Curry_Rawas-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>A visit to Mumbai is incomplete without trying out coastal cuisine, that’s done just right. Mahesh Lunch Home at Juhu (they have several branches), does Mumbai food better than just right. We had their<strong> Prawn Ghassi</strong>, which was a total burst of flavours on our taste buds, accompanied by light and fluffy Neer Dosas. We also ordered <strong>Malabar Curry with Basa Fish</strong>, which was cooked with authentic Malabar spices and rich coconut milk (yum!). Mahesh Lunch Home is frequented by the who’s who of Mumbai, so you might even brush shoulders with a celebrity while you gorge on your fill.</p><p>Head to Juhu Tara Road, Juhu, Mumbai</p><p><strong>Cost for two:</strong> INR 1,700</p><p>Contact them on 022 66955554</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>An Evening Of Drunken Revelry And Delectable Desserts In Colaba’s Iconic Cafes</strong></h4><p>We’re pretty sure you’ll be full after lunch. So head to Colaba, to down a couple of beers at the iconic Iranian cafés – Leopold’s and Café Mondegar. Leopold’s is always teeming with foreign tourists, locals and the ubiquitous Leopold&#8217;s waiters wearing red tee’s. The vibe is what you’ll really love to soak up at Leopold’s. Try the desserts at Leopold’s, their selection is on display. We’d recommend the <strong>Red Velvet Cheesecake</strong> (subject to availability). Just a few steps away, is Café Mondegar – Mumbai’s first café to have a jukebox. Mondegar is pretty crowded, almost at all times. The ambience is quirky, with wall paintings and murals by the famous Indian cartoonist Mario Miranda. These two cafés are like landmarks in Mumbai, and more than the Mumbai food it is the experience you must not miss out on.</p><p>Head to SB Singh Road, Colaba Causeway, Colaba, Mumbai</p><p><strong>Cost for two:</strong> INR 1,300 -1,600</p><p>Contact Leopold Café &amp; Bar at 022 22828185</p><p>Contact Café Mondegar at 022 22020591</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:<strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
