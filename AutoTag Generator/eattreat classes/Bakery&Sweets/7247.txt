7247	Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi	<p>The good people at Guava Trips, who’re the sister concern of Haveli Dharampura, took us around a food trail of the iconic places in Old Delhi through the bylanes and streets of Chandni Chowk and Chawri Bazaar. Our evening started with a little tour around the Haveli, followed by kite flying and high tea which had hot cups of strong <strong>masala tea </strong>and<strong> chaat</strong>. Our guide then took us through the lanes and alleys that contain centuries worth of history that have witnessed change in many forms.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shyam Sweets</strong></h4><p>Our first stop was at Shyam Sweets, which is known for its <strong>Nagori Halwa</strong> and <strong>Desi Bedmi</strong> (which are available only during breakfast). We got a glass of freshly made <strong>Lassi</strong> that was so thick, you could scoop it with a spoon. It isn’t overtly sweet, but lassi does make you feel sleepy after a point of time. So maybe get this on your way back instead.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 112, Barshahbulla Chowk, Near Metro Station, Chawri Bazar</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23268087</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 100 for two people (approx).</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shyamsweets112/" target="_blank">Shyam Sweets</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jain Coffee House</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407.jpg"><img title = "Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  "class="alignnone wp-image-7270 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407.jpg" alt = "sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5407-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>This has been around since 1948 and has been serving some really quirky sandwiches. They’re known for their <strong>fruit sandwich</strong> but they also have things like a samosa sandwich on their menu. One plate includes two sets of sandwiches that are filled with your choice of filling. We recommend that you get only one of these to try out since there’s a lot more food to come.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 4013, Raghuganj, Near PNB ATM, Chawri Bazar</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23918925</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 150 for two people (approx).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Khemchand Adesh Kumar’s Daulat Ki Chaat</strong></h4><p>You’ll find hawker’s selling <strong>Daulat ki Chaat</strong> on carts all over Dariba Kalan, Kinari Bazar, and Daryaganj. The frothy, sweet, creamy dessert is essentially the Indian version of the deconstructed cheesecake. We were told that the milk is boiled and cooled, and later churned for about 8 hours continuously to give it that light, almost buttery texture. It is enriched with khoya and saffron, and many top it with a little bit of crushed pistachio and almonds too.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Dariba, Kinari Bazaar and Daryaganj</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> +91 9654331721, +91 9899417485</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 100 for two people (approx)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jugal Kishore Ramjilal</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416.jpg"><img title = "Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  "class="alignnone wp-image-7269 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416.jpg" alt = "sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5416-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They’ve been around for the longest time and have people flock to them even on weekdays. They make the most interesting <strong>mixed chaat</strong>, which includes hollowed out sections of an apple, a potato, a tomato, and a cucumber, which are then filled with a little shallow-fried mix of masala green peas. You’re to eat the fruit or vegetable as a whole in one go.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 13, Dujana House, Chawri Bazaar, Chandni Chowk</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> +91 11 2326 6215</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 100 for two people (approx).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kuremal Mohan Lal Kulfi Wale</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422.jpg"><img title = "Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  "class="alignnone wp-image-7271 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422.jpg" alt = "sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5422-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Next, head to Kuremal for their variety of <strong>stuffed fruit kulfis</strong>. We asked for the <strong>Mango stuffed kulfi</strong>, and were surprised to see them pick a mango out of the deep freezer and peel it, in the middle of January! But wait, that’s not where the magic ends. They remove the seed of the mango and fill the hollowed out space with mango kulfi, and seal it until someone orders for one. There’s nothing better than to be able to enjoy the delicious summer fruit even in the peak of winter!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 526, Kucha Pati Ram, Bazar Sita Ram, Near Chawri Bazar Metro Station, Chawri Bazar</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23232430 &amp; +91 9810540105</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 300 for two people (approx).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Giani Di Hatti</strong></h4><p>Take one of the e-rickshaws and make your way over to Gianni’s in Chandni Chowk. They’re well known for their <strong>Chhole Bhature</strong>, but they’re equally famous for their glasses of <strong>Rabri Falooda</strong>. It’s fascinating to watch them ready the glasses for people to slurp their way through each of them.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 651/52, Church Mission Road, Fatehpuri, Chandni Chowk</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23936174</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 150 for two people (approx).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala</strong></h4><p>It is imperative that you get a couple of ‘donas’ of <strong>Dahi Bhalla</strong> from Natraj when you’re in Chandni Chowk, whether you’re on a food walk or not. You’ll never get to see these super soft, ready to fall apart bhallas anywhere else, at any other chaat walla. They put in some special masalas so it’s not as sweet as the ones you’ve been having all along either.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 1396, Main Road Near Central Bank, Opposite Paranthe Wali Gali, Chandni Chowk</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> +91 9811208811 &amp; +91 9811167400</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 150 for two people (approx).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kanwarji Bhagirath Mal</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432.jpg"><img title = "Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  Take A Trip Through History With This Food Walk In Old Delhi  "class="alignnone wp-image-7268 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432.jpg" alt = "sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   sweet street food savoury heritage food walk Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_5432-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Go here especially for their <strong>Gulab Jamuns</strong> that are so soft, they fall apart as soon as you touch them. They’re best had when they’re hot. You can even pack a few boxes to take home.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 1972-1973, Corner Gali Paranthe, Opposite Central Bank, Chandni Chowk</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 64651318 &amp; +91 8802219883</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 100 for two people (approx).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pt.

We know you’d have had way too many sweets at this point, but you absolutely have to get a <strong>jalebi</strong>, even if you’re only going to have it later. They make these really nice, thick jalebis that are completely drenched in sugar syrup. You will always find people asking for plates of these even when they’re about to close.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Dariba Kalan, Chandni Chowk</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23256973</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 200 for two people (approx).</p><p>Explore Guava Trips <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guavatrips/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
