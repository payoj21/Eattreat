6163	Khatti Meethi Margherita & Dirty Rose: Cocktails At Barcelos Are Killing It	<p><strong>Chatpati Diary</strong> takes us to this Portugese cocktail bar &amp; dessert tasting and we are feeling all kinds of high (sugar and otherwise). Barcelos brings the rich wine culture of Portugal here through their cocktail bar. And the Portuguese food is almost always a hit.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>They have already won people’s hearts through their exotic bar menu which includes molecular drinks, sangria, boozy shakes and now taking it to another level, they also have an exclusive Portuguese cocktail bar.</p><p>With today’s emerging global trend of fast-paced living, there is little time available for traditional food. Therefore, Barcelos strives continually to find a perfect balance between the traditional, healthy home-style cuisine and the fast lane demands of the modern world. Barcelos is an Afro-Portuguese restaurant specialising in Peri Peri Flame Grilled Chicken. With a single operation founded in Pretoria, South Africa in 1993, Barcelos has grown exponentially which led it to start franchising in 1998. Ever since this gourmet of burger chain opened in Khan Market it has been a hit amongst the people.</p><p>The ambiance is bewitching. Spread over two floors, this place has a warm inviting feel with well laid out massive space &amp; comfortable seating. The interiors have been done tastefully with a lot of wall paintings reflecting the theme of Portugal.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A Mix Of Heady Cocktails &amp; Desserts</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/006.jpg"><img title = "Khatti Meethi Margherita &amp; Dirty Rose: Cocktails At Barcelos Are Killing It  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6165" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/006.jpg" alt = "restaurants Portuguese desserts cocktail Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/006.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/006-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/006-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>So after creating a huge buzz by introducing colored burgers, Barcelos is back with another interesting concept for those who love their drinks and for all the sweet-toothed people like myself. It brings the rich wine culture of Portugal here through their Portuguese Cocktail menu. First up, we were greeted by the delightful <b>Dirty Rose</b>, a small-sized glass containing wine, rose essence and tropical fruit &#8211; all topped with dried rose petals. The fruitalicious blend somehow left us with the pleasant aftertaste.</p><p>Next was the Indian classic cocktail <b>Khatti Meethi Margherita</b>, infused with tequila, fresh lime, mint leaves, tamarind and watermelon. It was refreshing and is definitely a popular choice amongst the ladies.</p><p>We were in love with <b>Doce</b>. A blend of red port wine, a spoon of vanilla ice cream to give a creamy texture to it, cinnamon, raspberry syrup  with sprinkled chocolate powder. This drink was a pure bliss.</p><p>As for Portuguese food, <b>Fries and Wedges Platter</b> was served with 3 dips &#8211; mayo, peri mayo and cheesy jalapeño mayo which was our favourite.</p><p>Up next was <b>Arabic Mezze Platter</b>, it comes with the fresh hummus, baba ghanoush, tzatziki, pesto hummus and tabbouleh with the crispy falafel and spongy pita.</p><p>Now comes the sweet part of this review, dessert that is, <b>Golden Chocolate Cake</b> serve with meringue and <b>Black Forest Ice Cream</b> was luscious. Ice cream was vanilla based with chocolate flakes and cherries. Though <b>Traditional Cheesecake</b> with gulab jamun base didn’t have the perfect consistency but small sized gulab jamun that were served separately with it was on point. The best part about ice cream here is that it is made in-house, so fancy some <b>Peanut Butter Ice Cream</b>? Go for it as it gives a flavorful after taste.</p><p>Overall, we enjoyed this experience and all credit goes to the staff and prowess of the chef. Presentation and hospitality was remarkable. Barcelos strives to serve something different in a market that is already full of restaurants serving everything and they manage to hold their ground well when it comes to Portuguese food. Hence, their cocktail and dessert menu is worth a try.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of <strong>Chatpati Diary</strong></em></p><p><em>This article was originally published on <a href="https://chatpatidiary.wordpress.com/2016/06/12/portuguese-cocktail-bar-dessert-tasting-barcelos/" target="_blank">Chatpati Diary</a>.</em></p>
