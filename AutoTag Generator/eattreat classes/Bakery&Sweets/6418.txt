6418	An Offbeat But Absolutely Creamy Dark Chocolate Soufflé With Rice Flour Recipe	<p>This delicious dark chocolate soufflé recipe adapted from Alic Medrich’s Flavor Flours uses rice flour instead of wheat flour, for a luxurious, creamy texture. Rice flour recipes aren&#8217;t as healthy as the other option but the silky quality of the soufflé more than makes up for it.

To coat with sugar, fill one of them with the sugar, tilt the cup and rotate over a second cup until the bottom, sides, and rims of both are completely coated with sugar. Pour excess sugar into the third cup and repeat until all cups are coated.</p><p>In a small saucepan, melt one tablespoon of butter and add half a cup of milk, white rice flour and salt. Whisking constantly, bring the mixture to a boil and simmer gently for about a minute and a half to cook the flour (rice flour recipes FTW). Remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate has completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Scrape into a large bowl and whisk in the egg yolks, vanilla and remaining one tablespoon of milk. Set aside.</p><p>Beat the egg whites using a handheld beater on medium speed until soft peaks are formed. Gradually sprinkle in the sugar and continue to beat on high-speed until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold one quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, before folding in the remaining egg whites. Divide the mix evenly among the ramekins, filling them at least three quarters full. The soufflés may be prepared to this point, covered and refrigerated for up to three days before serving.</p><p>Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Set the ramekins on a baking tray and bake for 15-17 minutes, until a toothpick plunged into the centre tests moist but not runny. The soufflés will rise and may crack on top before they are done.</p><p>Remove from the oven, dust tops with powdered sugar and serve immediately with whipped cream (if using).</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Azra Sadr</strong></em></p>
