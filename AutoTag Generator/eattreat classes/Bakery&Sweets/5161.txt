5161	A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science & Desserts Together	<p>The days have become colder, and the nights longer; and it’s always a little hazy outside. What better than to get colourful desserts to cheer ourselves up, right? Dezertfox in GK has come out with more of their mind-blowing desserts (each of which have a new look) to spread the cheer all through this season.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Dezertfox is a fairly <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//salted-caramel-cake-bakery-delhi/">new bakery </a>and is known to be quite experimentative with flavours. They’re one of the few places that use more ingredients that are not just chocolate or fruit puree, and probably the only place that makes pre-plated desserts. We love that the desserts have many layers of flavours to them and the patissiers are unafraid to use ingredients that would normally go into savoury dishes.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hazelnut Dome</strong></h4><p>This beautiful creation stands tall and has the subtle flavour of almonds in the shortbread, and hazelnuts in the praline crisps and the silky chocolate ganache. We loved digging into this and feel that it’s just the perfect thing to satiate your mid-day sweet cravings.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dark &amp; White Mille Feuille</strong></h4><p>They’ve tried to recreate the Mille Fuille—the classic dessert that, quite literally, has a thousand layers; made of dark and white chocolate, and is placed on a very subtly flavoured rose petal dust. They’ve also placed a pretty little citrus macaron so that the chocolate flavours don’t completely swamp your taste buds. This one is gluten free too.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Coriander Passion Fruit Curd Tart</strong></h4><p>This dessert has flavours in so many layers, it’s crazy. One can’t fathom how something like coriander and basil can come together in a dessert and make it so beautiful. The coriander gel spheres and basil cream cut through the tartness of the passion fruit to balance flavours in the dessert very well.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Matcha Chio</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Matcha-Chio.jpg"><img title = "A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science &amp; Desserts Together  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5186" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Matcha-Chio.jpg" alt = "winter desserts Category:Bakery cake bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Matcha-Chio.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Matcha-Chio-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Matcha-Chio-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>This one has flavours of the matcha green tea and pistachio nuts and has a lovely lingering taste that stays for quite some time in the mouth. It’s balanced with the pineapple compote, and is the perfect end to any meal.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Season’s Best Philadelphia</strong></h4><p>This will be an instant favourite for anyone who loves <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//lopera-new-menu-new-store-gurgaon/">cheesecakes</a> and struggles for a gluten-free version. The cheesecake has delicious citrus flavour, and has a flourless chocolate sponge instead of the regular cookie crumb base, and is placed very beautifully on an orange glaze.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chocolate Sin (New edition)</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chocolate-sin.jpg"><img title = "A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science &amp; Desserts Together  A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science &amp; Desserts Together  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5183" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chocolate-sin.jpg" alt = "winter desserts Category:Bakery cake bakery   winter desserts Category:Bakery cake bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chocolate-sin.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chocolate-sin-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chocolate-sin-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They’ve had this on their menu since quite some time, but have given it a new look. They’ve encased a whipped chocolate ganache in a beautiful cocoa crepe that looks like a log, and there are some very nice flavours from the creme patisserie and chocolate chip. Decadence at its best!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Naariyal Pani</strong></h4><p>Interestingly enough, this one comes with a straw in it. This is a silky, light tender coconut mousse and has a coconut jelly center. What’s more is that they’ve put in a little coconut water for you to sip on with the straw that they’ve given you. Who says you can’t enjoy summer flavours in the cozy winter season? And summer got a new look in this one as well.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Red Velvet Tiramisu Bon Bon</strong></h4><p>What a sinful delight, this one. It tastes as wonderful as it looks. The flavours from the raspberry coulis, the coffee liqueur, creme fraiche, and dark chocolate complement each other very well.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Passion Fruit Framboise</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Passion-Fruit-Framboise.jpg"><img title = "A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science &amp; Desserts Together  A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science &amp; Desserts Together  A New Look Guaranteed: Dezertfox Brings Science &amp; Desserts Together  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5181" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Passion-Fruit-Framboise.jpg" alt = "winter desserts Category:Bakery cake bakery   winter desserts Category:Bakery cake bakery   winter desserts Category:Bakery cake bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Passion-Fruit-Framboise.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Passion-Fruit-Framboise-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Passion-Fruit-Framboise-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They’ve put together layer upon layer of passion fruit mousse and raspberry jelly, and an almond madeleine cake. The cake helps with the sweetness of the dessert, as just the raspberry and passionfruit can be a tad overwhelming to your palate.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/df.dezertfox/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
