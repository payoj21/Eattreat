4329	Hearty Soups To Warm Your Family Dinner Time This Winter	<p>There’s nothing like a warm, hearty bowl of soup to warm you up especially when there’s more than just a nip in the air. We’re telling you our season favourites to keep you cosied up all through this time of the year for each family dinner time.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cream Of Mushroom Soup, Parallel</strong></h4><p>This one just blew us away. We have probably never tasted such a well-made Mushroom soup, anywhere in Delhi. The best part is that there are small chunks of it in every bite, and it is creamy without being too thick. You can ask for an add-on of chicken or prawns in your soup, but we think that it is great as is.</p><p>Explore Parallel <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paralleldel/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Murgh Yakhni Shorba, The Yellow Chilli</strong></h4><p>A flavourful broth full of goodness, the Murgh Yakhni Shorba at The Yellow Chilli has become a favourite over the years. The broth is never watery and is seasoned to perfection. If you&#8217;re here for a family dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t miss ordering this.</p><p>Explore The Yellow Chilli <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Yellow-Chilli-1733551723568149/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pumpkin Coconut Soup, Auro</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4087.jpg"><img title = "Hearty Soups To Warm Your Family Dinner Time This Winter  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4100" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4087.jpg" alt = "winter soups seafood family dinner   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4087.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4087-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4087-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We recently checked out <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//coconut-kokum-peanuts-auro-brings-flavours-of-the-west-coast-to-delhi/" target="_blank">Auro</a> in Aurobindo Market and we still can’t stop raving about this soup. It is a wonderful soup with just the perfect balances of sweetness from the caramelised onions and isn’t overly spiced.

The vegetarian broth is spicy and full of julienned veggies with a hot samosa swimming in it&#8217;s midst. It&#8217;s a super filling dish and comforting to boot.
