We know. We mention SodaBottleOpenerWala one too many times when it comes to anything at all. But, they’re just that good! You MUST try their Matunga Coffee Cake which is served quite neatly in a filter coffee vessel, with the decadent cake in the bottom container, and a few pieces of tuile in the top one. We promise you, you will not be able to stop at just one portion.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SBOWIndia/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sinfully Yours</strong></h4><p>This home-baker makes a fantastic Marbled Bailey’s Chocolate Torte. The entire cake is full of Bailey’s, and you can taste it as you lick it off of your fingers, morsel by morsel. If you don’t like a runny cake, you should have it chilled, or in the Winter, when it stays set. Besides, the warmth from the liqueur and the notes of the coffee is just what you need to get you through Delhi’s winter.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SinfullyYoursIndia/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Whipped</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kahlua.jpg"><img title = "5 Coffee Cakes And Desserts That Will Warm The Cockles Of Your Heart  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4309" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kahlua.jpg" alt = "winter sweet coffee cake bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kahlua.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kahlua-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kahlua-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Whipped has established its name as a dessert parlour that makes some of the most visually appealing, beautiful desserts.
