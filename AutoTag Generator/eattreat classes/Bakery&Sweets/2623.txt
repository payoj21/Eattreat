A unique creation by the chef, it is light, smooth and absolutely heavenly; leaving you wanting more! If you want to indulge in something chocolaty, we suggest the <strong>Belgian Chocolate Mousse Cake</strong>. The dark chocolate mousse is smooth and has the perfect balance between bitter and sweet. If you are a macaron person, try their <strong>Lavender and Dark Chocolate Macarons</strong> for perfect texture, smooth ganache and a popping flavour!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The location is quite hard to find and delivery takes a minimum of two hours, so you got to sit tight for a bit before you can indulge in their sweet treats. (We suggest pacing about in anticipation to overcome the guilt of indulging in those calories, or maybe not!)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>The sweet scene in Delhi has come a long way and establishments like The Bombaykery are helping redefine the palate of Delhites with their fine creations. And we, are definitely on-board that bandwagon.</p><p>Explore The Bombaykery <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bombaykery/?fref=ts">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>The Bombaykery</strong></em></p>
