6202	Flluid Brings Out Food In Miniature Irons, Pressure Cookers & Shopping Trolleys!	<p>Chatpati Diary visited Flluid, Hotel Mosaic in Noida and we tagged along for all the food porn. We were overwhelmed by the amazing emphasis put on the presentation. Flluid came up diverse ideas like the <strong>Gun Powder Infused American Chowder Soup</strong> which was served in a skull shaped hip glass topped with gun powder masala.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>We began with a mocktail which was basically orange juice served in a liquor flask and the whole idea of starting our meal with a juice seemed healthy enough. Following this came in a snack in a miniature iron for us to guess what was inside of it. It was a starter which was a puff with healthy mushroom filling (we couldn&#8217;t guess it). Though cool, it was too small in size and we finished up in one go.</p><p>Just keeping the starters light, we were served <strong>Amritsari Masala Baked Fish</strong> which was served as small cubes with a slice of cucumber as the base for the cube for the entire snack to go in the mouth as a whole while for the vegetarians on our table it was <strong>Achari Paneer Tikka Tart</strong>. This dish was very rich in flavour and spices, and served as a canopy of paneer chunks. Talk about food porn, amirite.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img-20151212-wa0040.jpg"><img title = "Flluid Brings Out Food In Miniature Irons, Pressure Cookers &amp; Shopping Trolleys!

We were served the <strong>Caesar Salad</strong> prepared in mayo, olive oil, lettuce and other veggies and bread crumbs served in a big edible bun.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More</strong></h4><p>Next, we were served a house creation of 3 burgers which came with fries in a miniature shopping trolley. The speciality about these burgers was that each burger had a specific flavour to it – pink was beatroot, green was spinach, and the regular. We were served the <strong>Chicken Pudina Chaat</strong> which was typically Indian. Experiments could have been done with this one to make it more interesting but hey, chaat is chaat.</p><p>To bring an end to the evening we were served a lip smacking dessert- the <strong>Gulab Jamun Cheese Cake</strong>. Chunks of Gulab Jamun in English cheese cake along with Rasberry cheesecake as a topping given separately in a mini glass to add to the taste.</p><p>We sure enjoyed our trip to Flluid.
