In an effort to curb the growing rate of health issues like obesity and diabetes, the government is discussing the addition of fat tax in India on packaged foods that are high on salt and saturated fats, and all your favourite sugar-sweetened drinks.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>In a recent meeting with PM Modi to discuss budget proposals, this fat tax in India proposal was presented by the group of secretaries on health, sanitation, and urban development. This group has also asked that the proceeds from this tax be used to increase the government’s spending on health.</p><p>An official from the group said that this 11-member group suggested proposed the idea of a fat tax because the consumption of junk food and sugary beverages leads to lifestyle diseases like obesity, heart diseases, and diabetes. They feel that the proceeds should be used to further the government’s investment in health schemes.</p><p>This proposal has been in the pipeline since April last year. For this purpose, the government had also formed an inter-ministerial committee headed by the health secretary to mull over enforcement of stringent measures like higher taxes, and the restriction of ads and endorsements promoting junk food on television.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More</strong></h4><p>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is currently working on mechanisms to regulate the consumption of foods like these. They even recently released several guidelines on sale of junk food in schools. It owes to the fact that there’s a growing rate of lifestyle diseases and health risks at an alarming rate, and experts blame it all on the consumption of junk food.</p><p>The disease burden is also rampant among children. Globally, about 41 million children under the age of five have to be found to be extremely overweight or obese. In India, however, the prevalence of these diseases under this age group is less than 5%. But, WHO says that it is growing in a fast pace in all developing countries.</p><p>The government&#8217;s move is in line with the WHO which has been urging its member countries to regulate eating habits. Between the years 1990 to 2015, the number of overweight children in low and middle-income countries more than doubled from 7.5 million to 15.5 million. In 2014 itself, almost 48% of all overweight and obese children were found to be from Asia, and about 25% from Africa.</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/junk-food-sugary-drinks-may-invite-higher-taxes/articleshow/56578415.cms" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
