5225	#HeyRum // Delicious Rum Cakes & Desserts That’ll Sweeten Your Festive Spirit	<p>Demonetisation is causing a major cash crunch, so how about we combine our alcohol and desserts by reaching for these scrumptious rum desserts. So, let&#8217;s get boozy and a little snoozy with these rum cakes!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rum Ball</strong></h4><p>The forever-classic rum ball is our all time favourite. Rich and decadent, this truffle-like dessert has the best of both worlds with chocolate and rum! Try the <strong>‘Old Monk’ rum ball</strong> at Indian Accent for a fancy version or hit Wenger’s if you want the old-time comforting treat.</p><p>Explore more about Indian Accent <a href="http://www.indianaccent.com">here</a> and Wenger’s <a href="http://wengers.in">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rum Babas</strong></h4><p>Just the thought of this cake gets us drooling! Originated in France, this yeast cake is drowned in rum syrup giving it a strong alcohol kick. Either topped or filled inside with whipped cream, this shouts everything winters. These are hard to get so, you might wanna bake some at home because they are truly delicious!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rum and Chocolate Cake</strong></h4><p>A combination made in heaven. The richness of both these ingredients comes together to create one of the best cakes you can eat. Try the Old Monk rum cake available at Monkey Bar served with caramel and praline.</p><p>Explore more about Monkey Bar <a href="http://monkeybarindia.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rum Ice-cream</strong></h4><p>We know its winters, but haven&#8217;t you heard that ice-cream doesn&#8217;t follow seasons! So get over those nerves and go get yourself a scoop. Ironically called as the rum baba sundae, Oh So Stoned! does a coffee based ice cream mixed with drunken rum balls and topped with chocolate rum fudge.</p><p>Explore more about Oh So Stoned! <a href="http://www.ohsostoned.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Old Monk Mousse</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12185296_1648118738781614_7023258453372483775_o.jpg"><img title = "#HeyRum // Delicious Rum Cakes &amp; Desserts That&#039;ll Sweeten Your Festive Spirit  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3605" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12185296_1648118738781614_7023258453372483775_o.jpg" alt = "sweet desserts cocktail Category:Bakery cake alcohol   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12185296_1648118738781614_7023258453372483775_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12185296_1648118738781614_7023258453372483775_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12185296_1648118738781614_7023258453372483775_o-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Compiling a list of rum cakes and not include mousse?
