Everything she bakes is done so with a lot of love and care. She may be young, but the quality of her desserts speak volumes about her. She makes some of the yummiest cupcakes you would have ever had in all of Delhi.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/letsbakelovebysara/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sinful Bites </strong>by Niti Jolly</h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14409838_634590153386448_6262901814530412747_o.jpg"><img title = "These 3 Phenomenal Home-Bakers Are Sweetening Up Our Meals  These 3 Phenomenal Home-Bakers Are Sweetening Up Our Meals  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4119" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14409838_634590153386448_6262901814530412747_o.jpg" alt = "sweet home bakers desserts bakery   sweet home bakers desserts bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14409838_634590153386448_6262901814530412747_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14409838_634590153386448_6262901814530412747_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14409838_634590153386448_6262901814530412747_o-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Niti Jolly started baking almost 2 decades ago and has been making some beautiful cakes ever since. She used to bake bread too, but her major focus remains on cakes now. Her <strong>Tiramisu</strong> and <strong>Red Velvet</strong> cakes sell out almost instantly. They’re so good that every bite or spoonful of each of her desserts takes you to a whole other world. The portions are quite generous, but you can easily finish off a couple of these, and her very delicious <strong>Banoffee cups</strong>.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SinfulBitesbyMagicFingers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bling-a-Licious </strong>by Tanya Singh</h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14425328_634590056719791_1754410257843705959_o.jpg"><img title = "These 3 Phenomenal Home-Bakers Are Sweetening Up Our Meals  These 3 Phenomenal Home-Bakers Are Sweetening Up Our Meals  These 3 Phenomenal Home-Bakers Are Sweetening Up Our Meals  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4121" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14425328_634590056719791_1754410257843705959_o.jpg" alt = "sweet home bakers desserts bakery   sweet home bakers desserts bakery   sweet home bakers desserts bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14425328_634590056719791_1754410257843705959_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14425328_634590056719791_1754410257843705959_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14425328_634590056719791_1754410257843705959_o-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>This home baker is taking the city by a storm by making desserts healthy for the calorie conscious. One bite into their chocolate cupcakes, and we kid you not, you will not be able to figure out the difference between a regular cupcake and their version of it. What’s more is that it is super light and it feels like you’ve bitten into a cloud! They also make a low-fat granola, sugar-free almond crisps, and some very delectable <strong>Chocolate Almond Nougat Cake Jars</strong>.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blingalicious.confectionery/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
