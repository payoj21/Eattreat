We can’t wait for the madness to begin. Here’s what you should have on the 12 days leading up to Christmas. Consider it your own personal bucket list for the season.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 1: Apple Cider &amp; Mulled Wine</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mulled-Wine-at-Sakleys.jpg"><img title = "Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5246" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mulled-Wine-at-Sakleys.jpg" alt = "snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mulled-Wine-at-Sakleys.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mulled-Wine-at-Sakleys-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mulled-Wine-at-Sakleys-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Sakley&#8217;s &#8211; The Mountain Café</strong></em></p><p>These signature winter drinks are a must have for the Christmas season. You could make your own brew using, making your mulled wine more alcoholic and your apple cider that much more spicy; or get your own at any of these places <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//mulled-wine-restaurants-winter/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 2: A Platter Of Cold Cuts</strong></h4><p>A plateful of cold ham and turkey slices are a must have for when you’re having guests over. This simple finger food can be made even more special if you put it on canapés or get differently flavoured ones.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 3: Hot Buttered Rum</strong></h4><p>We kid you not, it tastes as great as it sounds. It’s extremely simple and quick to make, and is an instant crowd favourite. If you don’t want to make the effort of doing this at home, you can always head to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JungleeBilleeDelhi/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Junglee Billee</a> and catch up with friends of a mugful of deliciousness.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 4: Candy Cane</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Candy-Cane.jpg"><img title = "Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5384" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Candy-Cane.jpg" alt = "snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Candy-Cane.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Candy-Cane-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Candy-Cane-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>VisualHunt</strong></em></p><p>The stores are stocking it up, and you may even be able to get your expat friends to gift you a box or two (or more than just a few!). It makes for a great stocking stuffer too. You can change the way you normally have it by using one as a stirrer for your hot chocolate.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 5: Gingerbread Cookies</strong></h4><p>Christmas is even more special because of all the yummy treats that everyone makes during this time. Make a batch (or several) of these, get a glass of milk, and dunk away! We’ve even got a <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//gingerbread-cookies-recipe/" target="_blank">recipe</a> for you. Get away from the usual rum cake.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 6: Sparkling Wine</strong></h4><p>Open up the bottles of bubbly, that you’ve been saving all year. It finally is time. Grab a glass (by the stem, of course!) and pour in your favourite brand of sparkling wine, turn on a little Christmas music, and you should be all set!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 7: Seafood &amp; Salad</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Shrimp-Cocktail.jpg"><img title = "Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5383" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Shrimp-Cocktail.jpg" alt = "snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Shrimp-Cocktail.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Shrimp-Cocktail-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Shrimp-Cocktail-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>VisualHunt</strong></em></p><p>Make your own smorgasbord of delicious tossed prawns, shrimp cocktail, baked fish, and more. The best part is, you can have this both hot and cold. Get creative or have the holiday staples. Also make a great potato salad to go with it, or even just to have it with some delicious chicken gravy. You really can&#8217;t go wrong with this. Better still, just toss in whatever you have—chicken, salad leaves, a few aromatic vegetables, dried fruits and nuts, and you’ll have yourself your own version of a spectacular salad. And if not, head to The Spice Route for their <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//seafood-winter-menu-spice-route/">wondrous winter menu</a> that only has seafood.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 8: Minced Meat Pies</strong></h4><p>What is Christmas without a slice of the traditional Shepherd’s Pie? Make a large one, or a couple of smaller, personal sized ones and have it with some great grilled vegetables. You’ll forget the chaos of the season for a while, fer-sher.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 9: Custard</strong></h4><p>End your meals with this very simple and easy to make dessert. Have it as is, or load it with fruits. You could also convert it into a big bowl of Fruit Trifle with all the fruit cake you’re going to get.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 10: Roast Chicken</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-chicken.jpg"><img title = "Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  Rum Cake &amp; Wine: 12 Decadent Treats For Your 12 Days Of Christmas  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5375" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-chicken.jpg" alt = "snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   snacks Recipes party drinks desserts Category:Bakery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-chicken.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-chicken-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-chicken-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Public Domain Pictures</strong></em></p><p>Now this is something you just cannot miss, especially because you’ve seen this adorn the tables of many Christmas-themed movies. This may seem like a lot of work, but it’s going to be worth it. Make a really great stuffing for your chicken so all the flavours and juices come together to make a very delicious meal.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 11: Egg Nog</strong></h4><p>Get into the holiday spirit with some delicious Egg Nog. Whip up your own batch of this classic Christmas cocktail, and spend the rest of the evening in high spirits!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day 12: Plum Cake &amp; Yule Logs</strong></h4><p>The cakes are all baked, and there’s a warm fragrance of spices and rum-soaked fruits in the air. It’s time you sat down to relax and cut yourself a large slice of the Yule Log Cake, or the Rum Cake. You could make your own, or get one made by some of our <a href="http://shop.eattreatonline.com/" target="_blank">very talented bakers at the EatTreat Shop.</a> PS: Rum Cake is awesome.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
