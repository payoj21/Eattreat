5816	Hit These Stores To Get Your Boatload Of Baking Ingredients & Paraphernalia	<p>Stuff your bakery cabinets this holiday season by visiting these luxurious shops that stock up on everything sugar, from measuring spoons to cake flour! We love hoarding baking ingredients and equipment but during holidays we actually have a reason to, thus going over budget without regret (how could we know we won’t be needing a 3-tier cake stand while baking muffins!).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>CCDS, South Point Mall Gurgaon</strong></h4><p>CCDS is a baker’s holy grail! Think luxurious, extravagant and adorable, because their products are just that! They have top of the line baking chocolates because what&#8217;s better than Belgian high quality 53.8% dark chocolate by Barry Callebaut to help you make a mirror glaze. Selling Wilton products that make it irresistible to hoard we can only visit this shop around the festive season. Otherwise, our credit cards will be maxed out every month!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> A-13, Okhla Phase II, DDA Shed, Near Crowne Plaza Hotel, New Delhi<br /><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 4632 3679<br />Explore more <a href="https://ccdsshop.com/index.php?route=common/home" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Modern Bazaar</strong></h4><p>Modern Bazaar is every home-bakers sacred cave. Their in-house flour, chocolate chips and other baking ingredients are available at low prices and even though they have a shorter shelf-life of 3 months, you can significantly reduce your cost supplies by choosing them over the branded packs. Their extensive collection with everything local and imported makes it our go-to place whenever we want to pick up a whisk.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 15, Community Centre, New Friends Colony, New Delhi<br /><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 4066 6484<br />Explore more <a href="https://www.modernbazaar.co.in" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cake Craft, Sushant Arcade Gurgaon</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/baking-2.jpg"><img title = "Hit These Stores To Get Your Boatload Of Baking Ingredients &amp; Paraphernalia  "class="alignnone wp-image-5817 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/baking-2.jpg" alt = "online Kitchen gurgaon desserts cooking cookie chef Category:Bakery cake baking   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/baking-2.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/baking-2-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/baking-2-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pexels</strong></em></p><p>Cake craft has everything you need to stir up an expert level cake, maybe a tiered cake that is covered with fondant and adorned with gum paste flowers. These people have it al! Nestled in a shady market in the backend, this dainty shop is deceptively small. Once you enter, it’s a haven for baking ingredients. We highly recommend the food colours they stock, with a gel consistency these are ideal for gum paste and fondant colouring.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 201, United Plaza, second floor, Community Centre, Opp Karkardooma Metro Station, Karkardooma, New Delhi<br /><strong>Say hello at</strong> 093136 25751<br />Explore more <a href="http://cakecraftshop.in" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Home Centre</strong></h4><p>We know technically Home Centre shouldn’t be on the list because they do not hoard up on any edible or expert baking supplies. However, we love the basic bakeware they do stock. The quirky and colourful equipment really add that pop of colour in our cabinets. The plastic measuring cups, spoons, spatulas and bake tins available in neon and sky colours are absolutely amazing! So, do not forget them when you need to update your cabinet or get ready for your first baking experience.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Ambience Mall, 2-Nelson Mandela Marg, Vasant Kunj-II, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi<br />Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HomeCentreIndia/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>I Say Organic</strong></h4><p>Another store you wouldn&#8217;t normally find on a baking list but we understand the value of fresh produce for baking. When making anything fruit related, this is the place we call. They stock up some of the most beautifully fresh and organic fruits in the season which we exploit by making crème pâtissière and curd (we are ogling custard apple this week). However, that&#8217;s not all! You can also order flour, seeds, dry fruits, tea, coffee, basically anything you want to chuck into your baking batter!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Pocket C, Okhla Phase I, Okhla Industrial Area, New Delhi<br /><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 4108 7447<br />Explore more <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Defence Stores</strong></h4><p>Now, a grocery store isn&#8217;t something you would find on a list like this either, but this is one of the oldest stores in the Defence Colony Market and has both grocery items as well as a section for kitchen supplies. Get all your cake decoration supplies like piping bags, cupcake liners, doilies, fancy toothpicks, and things for your bakery kit like wooden and rubber spatulas, wooden spoons, pallet knives, and all sorts of whisks. You can find good quality ingredients in their grocery section upstairs as well.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> No.38, Defence Colony Main Market, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 6568 3496</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
