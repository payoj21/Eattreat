4454	Oranges, Lemons & Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season	<p>This winter, welcome nature’s fruity and colourful delights, with the season&#8217;s best citrus fruits!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The intensely juicy, fragrant, tangy and sharp flavoured citrus fruits are a crucial part of our winter palate. From being the infinitely loved king of winter fruits (orange), to being the latest super food (grapefruit), these gorgeous citric bombs are surely one of the best fruits known to mankind. The acidity in the fruit, gives it a sharp flavour, making it a genius ingredient for various culinary escapades.</p><p>The colour of the citrus fruit depends on the climatic conditions – at the time of summer in the tropical regions, the citrus fruits are either green or greenish-orange till the time they’re fully ripe. Not just a pretty thing, these sweet and sour fruits are also an excellent source of Vitamin C, and helps in detoxification of the body. Here’s a guide to the season’s juiciest citrus fruits that you need to start downing already.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Orange</strong></h4><p>Orange is the most common and loved fruit in the world. Sweet and sour, orange proves to be a perfect on-the-go snack, brimming with a heavy dose of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Avoid purchasing them during summers as you’ll only find unripen greenish ones (not half as juicy as the seasonal ones). Orange is also extensively used in winter menus across the world; from the c<strong>lassic upside down orange cake</strong> to the Christmassy combination of <strong>dark chocolate-orange</strong>, we seriously have a million reasons to love this fruit.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Grapefruit</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grapefruit-1647688_1920.jpg"><img title = "Oranges, Lemons &amp; Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4456" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grapefruit-1647688_1920.jpg" alt = "sweet sour healthy fruits desserts cake   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grapefruit-1647688_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grapefruit-1647688_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grapefruit-1647688_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><p>The beautifully pink grapefruit is a bittersweet citrus fruit. From adding it to your winter salads and desserts to eating it plain for breakfast- this wonder fruit is superbly juicy, versatile and healthy. As the saying goes “a grapefruit a day, keeps cellulite away”, eating grapefruit might just be the healthiest way to start your day.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kinnow</strong></h4><p>Remember that homemade orange colour juice (which was not exactly ‘orange juice’), that your mum would squeeze out from that ancient hand-pressed juicer each winter? That tangy, pulpy and natural goodness came from our homegrown kinnows. Known to be a hybrid mandarin, kinnow is mostly grown in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. Kinnow is loaded with vitamin C and B complex and is also a very a rich source of nutrients such and iron, phosphorous and other vital minerals.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Limes &amp; Lemons</strong></h4><p>You know you’re in a country where limes are grown in abundance, when <strong>nimbu pani</strong> (lime and water), becomes a standard beverage you encounter wherever you go! Though often used interchangeably, limes are not lemons, and lemons are not limes. This sour green fruit, which is commonly used in cooking, making beverages and as a naturally available astringent, is very low in cholesterol, saturated fat and sodium. Look out for limes that are aromatic and have a tight and waxy skin. Some of the Indian limes include the rather sweet and fragrant kargzi limes, and the thick, bumpy skinned and aromatic Bengali Gondhoraj lebu (used extensively in Bengali cuisine and kitchen).</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lemon-991085_1920.jpg"><img title = "Oranges, Lemons &amp; Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season  Oranges, Lemons &amp; Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4457" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lemon-991085_1920.jpg" alt = "sweet sour healthy fruits desserts cake   sweet sour healthy fruits desserts cake   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lemon-991085_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lemon-991085_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lemon-991085_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><p>On the other hand, lemons are less sour and juicier than limes. They’re bright yellow in colour, and just like limes, they are known to be a great source of vitamin C and limonoids (citrus components that are proven to fight several types of cancers). Meyer lemons are the sweeter variety of lemons often used in baking and for making other desserts.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Citron</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/citron-1241690_1920.jpg"><img title = "Oranges, Lemons &amp; Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season  Oranges, Lemons &amp; Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season  Oranges, Lemons &amp; Limes: All Things Citrus This Winter Season  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4455" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/citron-1241690_1920.jpg" alt = "sweet sour healthy fruits desserts cake   sweet sour healthy fruits desserts cake   sweet sour healthy fruits desserts cake   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/citron-1241690_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/citron-1241690_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/citron-1241690_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><p>A lesser-known fruit of the citrus family, citron hails from southern India. This fruit is a hybrid between sweet orange and lemon, and is also known as kaffir lime. Citron has a rough, dark green outer layer and is less acidic than lemon with a pleasant odour and flavour.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
