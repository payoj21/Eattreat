However, caramelisation shouldn&#8217;t be limited to just that! Try out these common ingredients you should be caramelising at home to<a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/salted-caramel-cake-bakery-delhi/"> intensify the flavour </a>and take your culinary skills to a new level.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Caramelisation is the browning of sugar that gives a nutty flavour and brown colour synonymous with caramel. The process is acutely temperature dependent and applied in a number of dishes including the classics like creme brûlée and caramel custard.</p><h4><strong>1. Pineapple&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Caramelised pineapple is the very definition of sweet and sour perfection. Whether you serve it as a dessert with yoghurt or as a side dish at a barbecue party, it’s delicious no matter what.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>Slice the pineapple in circles after peeling. Heat some butter in a pan and place the pineapple slices in it, after coating with sugar. Make sure the sugar is evenly coated to avoid burning. Cook on high heat until it gets a nice golden brown colour. Remove from heat and serve.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Onions</strong></h4><p>Caramelising onions make for a delicious canapé on top of toast or garnish for pulao. The caramelisation releases the sweetness from onions and takes away their strong pungent flavour.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>Add butter and olive oil in a shallow flat pan and let it melt at medium heat. Add the onions and leave them until they start tenderising, without increasing the heat. Add a pinch of brown sugar. Stir every 5-10 mins. It will take about 1 hour for 3-4 onions to caramelise completely. Reduce the heat after initial 20 mins and deglaze the pan with wine or water.

Walnuts</strong></h4><p>If you don&#8217;t like walnuts because of their bitter taste, caramelising them might just change your mind.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>Simply add chopped or whole nuts, butter and sugar in a pan. Stir constantly to ensure a nice even coating. Once the sugar has completely melted, remove from heat and allow to cool. Store in an airtight container and use when needed.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Apples/Bananas</strong></h4><p>Use caramelised apples as a topping for your waffles or filling for a pie. You can cook these for breakfast or at night to top a scoop of ice cream. Same goes for bananas.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat and add sugar from top. Once it starts to form a syrup, mix the chopped apples. Cook until brown and tender. For the bananas, put them in a pan of melted butter and and cook like you would the onions.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. White Chocolate&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Yes, caramelised white chocolate is a real thing! A lesser known ingredient for caramelisation at home, we ensure it will not disappoint.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>Chop a few white chocolate bars and spread on a sheet pan. Melt in the oven for 10 mins at 260 degrees Fahrenheit. Take out the pan and spread the chocolate evenly using a spatula or palatte knife. Once it&#8217;s spread, bake the chocolate until it reaches a brown colour, scraping it evenly every 10 mins. Add a pinch of salt according to taste.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
