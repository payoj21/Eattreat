Cakes made with almond, plum, lemon, strawberry, chocolate and walnut, horse shoe cakes, puffs made of mutton, chicken, egg — the bakery satisfies every taste bud. The most favoured baked item in the shop continues to be bread.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Smithfieldbakery/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Benney’s Bakes &amp; Cakes, Chennai</strong></h4><p>Benney’s has been serving since 1949 and is open in Royapuram, New Washermenpet, and Tondiarpet in Chennai.

People keep making the trip over and over again to get some fresh lemonade, burgers and cakes. The creamy mousse is one of a kind and the mayonnaise remains, till date, a trade secret. The goodies fly off the shelves at the speed of light, so we recommend you get there early.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hearsch-Bakery-Bandra-701786459847787/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gaylord, Mumbai</strong></h4><p>Making history since 150 years, they’ve got a variety of cakes and tarts in their bakery section at the restaurant.

The bakery still uses a wood-fired oven to bake all their famous bread. The sheer size of the ovens and bags of flour are enough to leave you speechless. Yazdani makes 1,000 <em>laadi</em> pavs each day (that would be 6,000 individual pavs). The regulars swear by their multi-grain bread, Brun Maska slathered with copious amounts of butter, their ginger biscuits, and the special rum-soaked plum cakes available during Christmas.</p><p>Explore them at Charni Road East, Girgaum, Khadikar Marg, Ambewadi, Girgaon, Mumbai</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lucky’s Bakery &amp; Patisserie, Panipat</strong></h4><p>Started relatively recently in 1991, Lucky’s is known for their signature date and walnut cake.

The green chutney and soft bread is a treat to bite into. It’s been around since 1965 and we now usually go to sit on the balconies and people-watch through a nice rainy day.
