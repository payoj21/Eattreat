Here’s the plan: Each of the the bakers are going to bring three of their favourite cakes, cupcakes, or desserts and you get to try them! honestly, we are glad we don’t have to pick favourites. If you’re looking for some fresh homemade goodies, here’s where you need to be.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Can You Get? </strong></h4><p>The range of these treats at this spectacular #foodfestival will include: popsicles, cupcakes, chocolates, macaroons, puddings, cakes, candy and everything in between. They will be serving 12 pm onwards, in case you&#8217;re planning to go (and we insist you do). This is being held at the store-café-bakery, so of course, we’re making our way here to pick up some gewgaws and gorge on all the yumminess.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> The Wishing Chair, LG35 South Point Mall, Golf Course Road, Gurgaon</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 4657 2121</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> between INR 100 &#8211; 200</p><p>Explore<a href="https://business.facebook.com/events/1779551712294322/" target="_blank"> The Sweet Spectacular</a></p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
