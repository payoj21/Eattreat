2691	Baking At Home? 5 Baking Tips To Avoid Kitchen Disasters!	<p>Baking at home is one half science and one half emotion, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you canâ€™t avail cheats to refine those skills. Use these tricks to avoid kitchen disasters the next time you decide to pick up a whisk.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Use Eggs At Room Temperature&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>A simple and efficient trick to improve your baked goods is to use eggs at room temperature. This makes a significant difference while stirring up some complex cakes when baking at home which involve whipping air into the batter.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> At room temperature, beating eggs traps air. In the oven, the trapped air expands allowing the cake to become fluffy. It is also responsible for finer and more even texture as compared to the crumbly texture from using cold eggs. Cold eggs do not disperse evenly in the batter.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> To bring the temperature down quickly, soak the eggs in warm water for 10-12 mins after removing from refrigerator.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Freeze Granita In A Metal Tray</strong><b>&nbsp;</b></h4><p>Granita is one of the simplest things to make and can be served as a palate cleaner or dessert. However, having to take out a fork every few minutes to break the ice is too much trouble. Freeze it in a metal tray and you can increase the intervals between fork attacks.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Breaking ice with a fork separates the crystals and storing it in a metal container allows the mixture to remain cold and at the right consistency, as it a good conductor of heat.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Use flat trays to make the process simpler and always break the ice away from corners.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/photo-1451475836122-926a326bda4f.jpeg"><img title = "Baking At Home? 5 Baking Tips To Avoid Kitchen Disasters!

Freeze Cookie Dough Before Baking</strong></h4><p>A good cookie is all you need to take away your troubles. However, getting the perfect texture is not so simple. Often the cookie dough spreads too much in the oven, making them flat and in turn more crunchy. Freezing the dough ensures you get a smaller, stronger cookie with more enhanced flavours.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Chilling the dough for 24 hours before baking allows the fat to freeze and the flavours to become more pronounced. When baking in the oven, the fat melts more slowly keeping its shape smaller and the colour darker.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Measure the dough into balls and chill for one hour, after which simply add them to an air tight ziplock and freeze.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Chilling Before Whipping</strong></h4><p>Whipped cream is the best thing to add on cakes, crumbles and just about anything. However, achieving perfection while whipping cream is a different task all together. Chilling the cream, bowl and the mixer, before whisking allows for more loftier and stable peaks.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Whipping the cream is based on introducing air bubbles in solid fat. By chilling the material beforehand, the fat can remain solid for a longer time allowing more air bubbles in during the whipping process.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Whisk as revolutions and rotations to allow uniform distribution of air.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Never Store Lemon Desserts In Metal Bowls</strong></h4><p>After you have done the hard work of making a lemon custard, it feels absolutely crushing when it turns out having a metallic taste. To avoid such a disaster, never use metal bowls while making lemon desserts.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> The acid in lemon reacts with metal, releasing metal ions in the custard responsible for the metallic taste.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Always use glass bowls and rubber spatula while making something like lemon custard.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
