4259	Sweet News! Gurgaon Bakery The Bombaykery Brings Its First Retail Outlet! 	<p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//french-patisserie-bombaykery/">The Bombaykery</a> is our most beloved Gurgaon bakery and the one we watch out for at all food festivals (mostly because their limited delivery area deprives us of everyday binge-ordering). But it&#8217;s now ready to expand and serve their loyal patrons the way they want &#8211; with a retail store!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>The Bombaykery has taken the city by a storm with its petite desserts and indulgent cakes and cookies, working as an only delivery Gurgaon bakery. While we crave their desserts more often than we should (who cares about dieting when you can indulge in mouth-watering macarons and mignardises, right?), it’s the advance ordering which we worries us since we can’t always anticipate our sugar cravings!</p><p>They are now in works to open stores throughout the city and a little birdy tells us Vasant Kunj, Khan Market and Gurgaon are the most likely locations! From what we know, the first store could be opening next month! *Fingers crossed*</p><p>Explore The Bombaykery <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bombaykery/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>The Bombaykery</strong></em></p>
