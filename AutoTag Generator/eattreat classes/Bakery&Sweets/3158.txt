3158	New Healthy Menu At The Artful Baker Is Here!	<p>The Artful Baker turned one this September and we are celebrating the occasion with their new healthy menu. The low GI and vegan products have us swooning. Delicious desserts and healthy ingredients? We couldn&#8217;t say no if we wanted!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things FirstÂ </strong></p><p>Gluten free diet excludes the protein gluten, widely found in grains such as wheat, rye and barley. A low glycemic index diet has been trending, as it leaves you fuller for longer, helping you eat less and lose weight.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food &amp; Drinks</strong></p><p>The Artful Baker jumped in on the health wagon with whole wheat multigrain croissant, gluten-free bread, muffins, cupcakes, cookies and an indulgent sugar-free chocolate layered cake! Thats not all, they have also introduced low GI cakes and cupcakes to accompany some lip-smacking healthy fruit and chocolate smoothies.</p><p>Explore The Artful Baker <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArtfulBakerIndia/?pnref=story" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>The Artful Baker</strong></em></p>
