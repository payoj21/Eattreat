5144	Freakshakes & More: 5 Eye-Gasmic Treats You Have To Try At AMPM Cafe	<p>Salt &amp; Sandals took us on a gluttonous trip to AMPM Cafe, and of course, we more than loved it. Freakshakes, desserts in jars and lots more, this is what you have to look forward to.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>New Delhi is currently witnessing a revolution in the dining culture. Many restaurants with new and interesting concepts are opening with a bang, but soon are fading away in no time. This unit of Bright hospitality, AMPM Café located in Rajouri Garden&#8217;s BK Dutt colony, on the other hand, has kept things fairly simple and basic. The team’s focus has always been on giving its patrons a cool and cosy atmosphere with some great food and beverage offerings and so have they been successful to build up a loyal customer base.</p><p>The recently introduced Lickables (shakes) menu at AMPM is a fresh new reason to fall in love with the café all over again. Starting with a price tag of just INR 200 , the range of shakes are not only a great value for money, but also super refreshing and delicious. Here is a list of few which freakshakes you should try.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Magnum Upside Down</strong></h4><p>An entire magnum bar and cone of vanilla ice cream inverted on top of the jar, with the milkshake and bits of the broken crust of the ice cream coming through with each sip.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ferrero Rocher Donut Surprise</strong></h4><p>Take a bite of the soft and fluffy doughnut and then a sip of the thick and delicious shake loaded with bits of Ferrero Rocher chocolate.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gummy Bear &amp; Candy Floss</strong></h4><p>Your kids will love this one. Soft gummy bears stick to the jar, and multicoloured candy floss is covered with little heart cookies on top. The milkshake is perfectly sweet and delicious.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Blushing Red Velvet</strong></h4><p>Though the other shakes are fantastic, This one was our favourite. A moist and rich slice of red velvet cake is the topping and the shake is as delicious as it looks.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tiramisu Drool</strong></h4><p>Tiramisu lovers should not miss this one. The shake is super thick with balanced sweet and bitter tastes topped with a slice of cake. You will actually feel that you are drinking Tiramisu.</p><p>Do visit AMPM for these amazing Lickables, and much more to have a great time with your loved ones.</p><p>Also not to be missed at the AMPM Cafe are the Liquergy, Chili Prawns, Cottage Cheese Steak and The Chocolate Bomb.</p>
