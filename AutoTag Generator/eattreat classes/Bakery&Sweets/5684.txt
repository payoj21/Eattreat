5684	Be Merry With The Most Adorable Christmas-Themed Desserts From Bombaykery!	<p>We are revelling in the Christmas season and The Bombaykery seems just as excited! They have launched an exclusive Christmas menu and we are drooling over it.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p><strong>Choux pastry</strong> made in the shape of a snowman, now that&#8217;s what we are talking about! While we don’t really need a reason to gorge on their desserts we absolutely love how they have added a festival touch to them. Choux is not the only thing they have shaped, the <strong>coffee flavoured macaron</strong> now looks like a reindeer(and an adorable one at that) with pretzel ears that not just look stunning but also taste delicious! That’s not it, the cupcakes available with snowflake decorations are giving us some serious frozen vibes. A decadent nutella or nutty chocolate cupcake with blue and white snowflakes on top is Christmas done right.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What’s More? </strong></h4><p><strong>Yule logs</strong>! These are literally the brand ambassador desserts for Christmas (other than gingerbread) and The Bombaykery yule logs have us sugar struck this season. Made with their signature Belgian chocolate mousse cake, these are gluten-free! But don’t worry, they also have the classic <strong>boozy plum cake</strong> in case you want some alcoholic indulgence (of course just to settle the nerves, you understand).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hot Chocolate</strong></h4><p>As we order ourselves (bulks of) their Christmas desserts, we can’t miss out on the <strong>hot chocolate</strong>. Silky, smooth, creamy Belgian chocolate mixed with milk, topped with marshmallows and candy cane, we need to sit down. Spike it with tequila and peppermint schnapps, but don’t tell anyone (it’s our Christmas secret)!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bombaykery/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
