3988	These 11 Diwali Sweets Have Become Iconic Over The Years. But How?	<p>So it&#8217;s that time of the year again! With the festival of lights right around the corner, it&#8217;s time to sweeten our taste buds. No festival in India is complete without gorging on those delicious, mouth watering sweets and Diwali is no exception.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>So, in case you are yet to make a mental list of the sweets you&#8217;d bring to the platter this year, here&#8217;s a look on all the famous sweetmeats that our country is famous for along with a scoop of their histories. Get your taste buds ready for the delectable ride through yum-town!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Motichoor Laddu</strong></h4><p>This sweet ranks high on the popularity meter. Made from ground flour, semolina, a dollop of that heavenly ghee and garnished with almond powder, this sweetmeat gets the taste buds dancing to their rhythm.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra</strong> While the origin of laddoos is a debatable topic, it is said that the laddoo was accidentally discovered by the erstwhile<em> vaids</em>. They used the laddoo to fool the patients into having the bitter herbal concoctions. The southerners stake their own claim on the laddoo. The coconut laddoo or the<em> nariyal</em> laddoo finds its mention in the pages of history during the reign of the Gupta dynasty.</p><p>Bihar has it&#8217;s own story to tell. It is said that the laddoo originated in the Mithilanchal region of Bihar during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. Quiet a history! But one thing&#8217;s for sure, the day the laddoo originated, it was made to have a permanent place in our cookbooks and our culture.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rasgulla</strong></h4><p>It is said that a tour of West Bengal isn&#8217;t complete without tasting this delectable sweetmeat made from <em>chhena</em> soaked in a sugary syrup. It&#8217;s so light and fluffy, it just melts in the mouth giving us foodies the time of our lives. Already drooling, huh? Anyway, the rasgulla is also the bone of contention between two states both of which claim it to be their own creation.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra</strong> While West Bengal claims that the rasgulla was the creation of  confectioner Nobin Chandra Das in 1868 for his sweet shop located at Sutanuti (present day Baghbazar), Odisha has put up a fierce competition against this, claiming the rasgulla was their creation. According to the historians there, it originated in Puri and has traditionally been offered as a bhog to Goddess Laxmi in the very famous Jagannath Temple of Odisha. The matter was finally brought to a close this year when the verdict was passed in favour of  Odisha. Having said that, the rasgulla still continues to be a huge part of Bengali culture.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Phirni</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Phirni.jpg"><img title = "These 11 Diwali Sweets Have Become Iconic Over The Years.

After all, who could resist a plate of biriyani alongside this lip-smacking dessert?</p><p><strong>#EatExtra</strong> Although it is uncertain as to where this dessert actually originated, it is said that it was introduced in India by the Mughals.
