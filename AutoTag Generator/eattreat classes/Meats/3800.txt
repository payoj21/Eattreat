Once a nice brown colour is achieved, add mushrooms and sauté until cooked. The mushrooms release water as they cook, so keep the heat at medium. Deglaze the pan with white wine/chicken stock. If you do not have any of these available, deglaze with water. Pour the cream and cook until it reaches a slightly thick consistency. Add salt to taste and a nice amount of pepper for heat. Add tarragon for garnishing.</p><p>Toast up a few bread slices and your comfort meal is ready!</p><p><em>Representative Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
