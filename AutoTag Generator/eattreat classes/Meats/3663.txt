It was a preparation of boneless shredded chicken cooked in a moderately spiced tomato and cashew gravy. We felt that it was just the perfect thing and the light <strong>Rumali Rotis</strong> went very well with it. We also loved the <strong>Mutton Nawabi Chop</strong>, which was so well-cooked that the meat practically fell off the bone. The <strong>Phirni</strong> tasted as good as it looked, and we scraped off every bit of the creamy goodness from the bowl that it came in.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><strong>Burrani</strong>, a drink made with yogurt and flavoured with cumin and mint, which is traditionally a chaser for biryani; was a little over spiced. Also, while the Chicken Biryani wasn’t very spectacular, we loved that they had included potatoes in it to keep it authentic, Calcutta style.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>DomDom Biryani is a great place for you to get good dum-cooked biryani with some yummy sides when you’re on the go, or just ordering in. The food is reasonably priced, and the quantities are pretty great too.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/domdombiryani/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
