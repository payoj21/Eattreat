7940	Seafood Galore With Salmon Lohe & Chilean Sea Bass At Chi Ni, The Roseate	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the earliest users of mock meat in Delhi&#8217;s culinary landscape, Chi Ni at The Roseate is one of Delhi&#8217;s hidden gems, mostly because people are so unaware of Chinese fine dine in Delhi. This tented restaurant at one of Delhi&#8217;s most picturesque hotels spellbounds you both visually and gustatory. Built on the concept of the Michelin starred restaurant Kai at the Mayfair hotel in London, Chef Lauh Ah Ban presents an oriental menu with a western influence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese new year holds tremendous significance in the Oriental world and the new menu does proper justice to it. Restaurant manager Neeraj Sharma also gets his chopsticks ready as we discuss the lucky charm of number 8 on the menu. </span></p><h4><strong>What We Gorged On</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2.jpg"><img title = "Seafood Galore With Salmon Lohe &amp; Chilean Sea Bass At Chi Ni, The Roseate  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8017" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2.jpg" alt = "Thai restaurants luxury fine-dine Chinese Category:Restaurants asian   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170206_155959062-2-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start off with the <strong>Salmon Lohe</strong>. With 25 different ingredients, this salad is a melange of flavours, aroma and textures. In Chinese families, the tossing of this salad is associated with wish making. The umami flavour of the salmon combines with the sour of lime and the extreme sweet of an orange marmalade. Some crisps gives it a crunch while the cinnamon powder imparts a heavenly aroma. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neeraj sets out a menu for me. The <strong>Prawn Hargao</strong> retains the sweet juiciness of the prawn in a sweet and spicy sauce. The <strong>Wasabi Prawns</strong> on the other hand are fried up in a potato starch giving it a surprisingly crispy texture. The Wasabi Mayo lathered on it gives out it&#8217;s pungency but in a controlled manner. The <strong>Salt and Pepper Bean Curd</strong> with a net of eggs on top virtually dissolves on your palate. </span></p><h4><strong>Main-ly Chinese&nbsp;</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the mains, we try out a <strong>nutty egg fried rice</strong>. Along with that, there is some <strong>Seaweed Chicken</strong> and Roasted garlic vegetables. The chicken with it&#8217;s fiery taste is apt for Delhi&#8217;s palate. Chef Ban serves me a <strong>Chilean Sea Bass</strong> done in typical Singaporean style. The sweetness of the fat with tangy sauce gives it a perfect flavour. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We end off with a<strong> Sweet Potato Cake</strong> and a <strong>Coconut Cake</strong>. With a base made like pounded rice, these moderately sweet desserts don&#8217;t leave you feeling heavy. Pastry Chef Anand Panwar comes out with one of his specialities, <strong>Splendid Yoghurt</strong>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do try out Chi Ni&#8217;s eclectic new menu if you&#8217;re in mood for authentic Oriental chow.</span></p><div><p><strong>Head to&nbsp;</strong>The Roseate, 21st Milestone, Samalkha, NH-8, Near, Rajokri, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;011 3355 2211</p></div><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR&nbsp;5,000 for two people (approx.)</p>
