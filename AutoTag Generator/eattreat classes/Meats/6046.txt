6046	An Authentic Goan Food Trail For Your Weekend Trips To Goa	<p>Goa &#8211; the pint-sized land of sun, sand and spices. Whether you’re going there for the first time, or are a frequent visitor, the beaches and laid back tropical vibe make for a perfectly blissful experience. Goa is the party capital of India, and high on everyone’s list of Christmas and New Year vacation destinations. A distinct cultural landscape and an exquisite indigenous cuisine make Goa rank high on food trail lists too. If you’re thinking of visiting Goa this time of the year, and wondering where to head to for sampling some splendid local (and other) fare, we’ve curated a guide for a fun Goa food trail.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Breakfast: Citrus Café, Lemon Tree Amarante</strong></h4><p>Citrus Café does a full power buffet breakfast that has tonnes of variety. From South Indian <strong>Dosas</strong> and <strong>Idlis</strong> (With a zingy sambhar), to <strong>Pancakes</strong> and <strong>Waffles</strong> – they really do have variety. It’s the perfect breakfast to kickstart your day. They have a wonderful buffet breakfast that you must make your way towards.</p><p>Head to Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort, Candolim, Goa</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> INR 1,200 for two</p><p>Follow Lemon Tree Hotels, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lemontreehotelsco/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lunch: Sea food At Vagatore’s Shacks</strong></h4><p>Vagatore beach is adjoining the famous Anjuna beach in North Goa and has a distinctly laid back vibe that you will love if you’re looking to unwind away from the stressful big city life. Try Fish Tail Shack, for its awesome, fresh and flavoursome sea food. We recommend the <strong>King Prawn Platter</strong> and <strong>Goan Fish Curry</strong> (Because when in Goa, don’t miss the local flavours). You could also head to the next-door Kumar’s Shack, for its <strong>Prawn Spring Rolls</strong> and <strong>Chicken Club Sandwich</strong>. High on taste, low on price.</p><p>Head to Vagatore Beach, North Goa</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> INR 600 for two</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dinner: Tuscany Gardens, Candolim</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11025206_649314795174795_8598904425132105026_o.jpg"><img title = "An Authentic Goan Food Trail For Your Weekend Trips To Goa  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6048" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11025206_649314795174795_8598904425132105026_o.jpg" alt = "seafood goan goa food walk fish Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11025206_649314795174795_8598904425132105026_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11025206_649314795174795_8598904425132105026_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11025206_649314795174795_8598904425132105026_o-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Tuscany Gardens</strong></em></p><p>Tuscany Gardens in Candolim opened its doors in 2007 and is a family run restaurant. It is the perfect place to eat when you’re full of curries, or crave a perfectly done thin crust pizza and al dente pasta. We highly recommend their <strong>Risotto con Pollo</strong> (with cubes of chicken breast and red peppers), and their <strong>Spaghetti al Gamberi</strong> (Prawns and chillies sautéed in spicy tomato sauce) is simply the best. From their extensive Pizzeria section, we recommend <strong>Pepperoni</strong> and <strong>Pollo Tricolore</strong> (Chicken, red &amp; yellow peppers and green chillies). This is the best way to end this gastronomical Goa food trail.</p><p>Head to Candolim (Near Kingfisher Villa), Goa</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> INR 1,000 for two</p><p>Explore more <a href="http://tuscanygardens.in/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
