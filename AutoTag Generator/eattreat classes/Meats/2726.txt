The <strong>Bhetki Paturi</strong> is a quintessentially Bengali dish, which is basically a filet of <i>bhetki</i> encased in a mix of mustard, salt, green chilly paste and lots of mustard oil for flavour. The fish and marinade is then wrapped in a banana leaf, tied with a string and steamed. The flavourful fish is then eaten with hot rice (we suggest you use your fingers to lick off that plate).</p><p>We’ve had a perfectly done <strong>Bekti Maacher Paturi</strong> at Oh! Calcutta Nehru Place and Cyber Hub. This one might be slightly pricy, so you can try the one at Bong Appetite too. They do Hilsa, King Prawns and Bhetki.</p><p>Molecule Air Bar does a molecular gastro version with <strong>blackened fish wrapped in banana leaf</strong> which comes along with a <strong>Kasundi Mustard Gel</strong>.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh!

Chefs use differing spices inside the parcel; for instance, some like a red Thai curry, whereas you can also make in a Hoisin and pepper style.</p><p>You can try the Pandan Fish Parcel at Rred Hot that has a spice marinated fish inside the aromatic leaf.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Karimeen_Ilayill_Pollichathu.jpg"><img title = "Banana Leaf Wrapped Fish Dishes From Across India &amp; Where To Find Them In Delhi  Banana Leaf Wrapped Fish Dishes From Across India &amp; Where To Find Them In Delhi  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2729" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Karimeen_Ilayill_Pollichathu.jpg" alt = "seafood restaurants lunch dinner Category:Restaurants   seafood restaurants lunch dinner Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Karimeen_Ilayill_Pollichathu.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Karimeen_Ilayill_Pollichathu-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Karimeen_Ilayill_Pollichathu-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rred Hot Cafe</strong></span></p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;110, 1st Floor, Cyber Hub,&nbsp;DLF Cyber City, Gurgaon</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at &nbsp;0124 401 4658</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 525 for a plate (approx.)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Karimeen Pollichathu</strong></h4><p>The Keralite <i>meen pollichathu</i> is a pretty typical dish loaded with spices and again, steamed in a banana leaf. The dish is a perfect mix of traditional and healthy, and here’s where we’ve tried and tested it.</p><p>The Pollichathu at Mahabelly is available in fish as well as prawn. The roasted fish is absolutely delectable and we usually go for the prawn variant and Rasam Mary, alongwith.

This dish is made in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Otak&nbsp;Otak is eaten by itself as a snack, and sometimes with steamed rice as part of a meal.&nbsp;</p><p>The Otak-Otak from Indonesia has a greyish colour, while the one from Malaysia and Singapore is red in colour; owing to the fact that they use turmeric, red chilli powder, and curry powder in the preparation. We tried the one from Asian Haus and well, we do recommend you get a bite of that.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asian Haus</strong></span></p><p><strong>Head to&nbsp;</strong>76/2, Near ISKCON Temple, Sant Nagar,&nbsp;East of Kailash, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;+91 9810043556,&nbsp;+91 9555800100</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 1,500 for two people (approx.)</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Asianhaus/" target="_blank">Asian Haus</a></p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
