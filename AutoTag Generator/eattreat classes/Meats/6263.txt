6263	Carl’s Jr. Is Finally Bringing Mutton Burgers To Delhi & They Are A Force To Reckon With!	<p>We have an unparalleled love for the chargrilled burgers at Carl’s Jr., so when we heard about their Muttonisation campaign we were more than excited! Now 16 months old in India, they have already gained a following for juicy patties which are as healthy as they are delicious, so our expectations for their mutton burgers in Delhi were high. Well, they exceeded them!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>#Muttonisation</strong></h4><p>Carl’s Jr. will be launching four mutton burgers in Delhi, early January 2017 and each of them is a force to reckon with. The line-up includes their signature famous <strong>star burger</strong> now available in mutton, an awesome <strong>onion burger loaded with fried and chargrilled onions</strong>, a special <strong>qorma burger</strong> and our utmost favourite <strong>mint burger</strong>. Full of flavour within the mutton, the exceptional quality is evident in the end product. The sauces are well-thoughtout and executed efficiently by managing quantity (we have seen dead burgers devoid of sauces and the ones loaded; getting it right isn&#8217;t that easy).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chargrilling</strong></h4><p>In a candid conversation with Samira Chopra (owner of Carl’s Jr. master franchise India) we discussed the chargrilling process that is the backbone of the Carl’s Jr. While questioning how the meat is cooked in its own juices and thus requires no oil, we understood just how healthy these are! (Relatively, of course). So try their shakes, and their amazing refillable soda offer and we can assure you that you&#8217;ll be a happy camper!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Landing In Gurgaon</strong></h4><p>January 2017 will be particularly pleasing for burger-lovers as Carl’s Jr. will be opening their fourth outlet in One Horizon Center, Gurgaon! After the expansion in NCR region, Carl’s Jr. will be hitting the highways, pleasing those going on long distance travels before taking over Punjab. While the company is expanding slowly, they are putting down a strong foothold by maintaining quality and thus, their customer base.</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarlsJrIndia/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
