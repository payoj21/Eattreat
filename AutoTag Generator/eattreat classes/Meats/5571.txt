5571	5 Mughlai Dishes We Never Miss Out On At Karim’s, Jama Masjid	<p>Rich, flavourful Pakistani and Mughlai dishes become even more irresistible in winters and who does it better than Karim’s! This establishment isn&#8217;t referred to as &#8216;iconic&#8217; for no reason. Bowlful of stews, kebabs and special rotis, we can gorge on these all night through. So, here is a list of 5 curries you need to try when ordering from Karim’s!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Established by Haji Karimuddin in 1931, Karim’s is now regarded as one of the iconic restaurants in Delhi. What began as a small shop in Gali Kababian, near Jama Masjid has now expanded into multiple outlets city-wide. However, not everyone agrees that the legacy has been continued. Failing to maintain consistency, there are varied opinions about Karim’s. While some still adore their Mughlai fare, others feel it&#8217;s washed out, but everyone agrees it will always be a place with memories. We leave it to you to decide whether you love them or don’t, but do try these curries before you decide!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Nihari</strong></h4><p>We love the traditional nihari at Karim’s, Jama Masjid and it will always hold a special place in our hearts. However, the other branches of Karim’s expanded throughout the city aren&#8217;t that great for this stew. One other branch which gets it right is in sector 14, Gurgaon. They make nihari only on weekends but it is quite spectacular.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Never eat nihari without its garnishes! Coriander, ginger, green chilli and lemon served with this Mughlai speciality aren&#8217;t just for eye appeal. Pair it with <strong>khameeri roti</strong> for a splendid meal.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Chicken Stew</strong></h4><p>A quintessentially winter dish, this chicken stew is beautifully creamy, rich but full of spices. Cooked without water in onions and curd, this simple dish shouldn&#8217;t be ignored. Available at almost all branches of Karim’s you should definitely give it a try this season!</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Pair it with <strong>sheermal</strong> to bring out the understated sweetness.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Badam Pasanda</strong></h4><p>While all the dishes at Karim’s seem to be floating around in oil, this one is particularly not for the ones who loathe the oily layer. A mutton curry with generous amounts of oil, almonds (not just chopped but also in full pieces) and black pepper.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Some branches require a pre-order for this dish, so please check in advance before you visit!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Chicken Jahangiri</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Karims_Chicken_Jahangiri.jpg"><img title = "5 Mughlai Dishes We Never Miss Out On At Karim&#039;s, Jama Masjid  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5629" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Karims_Chicken_Jahangiri.jpg" alt = "Mughlai meat lunch dinner Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Karims_Chicken_Jahangiri.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Karims_Chicken_Jahangiri-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Karims_Chicken_Jahangiri-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Blazing in a bright shade of red, this curry has its own unique taste. You will either hate it or love it, but the chilli and spices in this curry will definitely hit you well! Available at all Karim’s outlets, we hear the one in Karol Bagh does it best.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Pair with <strong>khameeri roti</strong> to soak all those flavours in the bread.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Paya</strong></h4><p>Only available at the Jama Masjid location, paya is trotters or goat&#8217;s feet. Cooked in a spicy curry, it is another Mughlai breakfast dish that will leave you feeling full and heavy. Particularly enjoyed in winters, it is slow cooked over the night.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> It can go well with <strong>sheermal</strong> if you have a low chilli tolerance or opt for <strong>khameeri roti</strong> if you want to enjoy the spiciness.</p><p>Explore more about Karim’s <a href="http://www.karimhoteldelhi.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Kake via Visual hunt</strong></em></p>
