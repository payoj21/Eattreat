Here’s our list of checklist for hosting a bbq that you absolutely must follow for a successful party that doesn’t leave you feeling like you’re going crazy!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Use Cupcake Liners As Lids</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">To avoid bugs from getting into your drink, make a hole in the centre of a cupcake liner and cover your glass/mason jar/cup. Push your straw through it to enjoy your drink.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/water-171756_1920.jpg"><img title = "7 Tips &amp; Tricks To Know For Your Next Backyard Barbeque  "class="alignnone wp-image-2590 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/water-171756_1920.jpg" alt = "savoury meat grill Category:Meats BBQ   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/water-171756_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/water-171756_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/water-171756_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Fill A Bucket With Frozen Water Balloons</strong></h4><p>Fill balloons with water and freeze them ahead of your party. Just before it starts, you can fill a tub or a bucket with the balloons and put the bottles of beer in it. It looks super pretty and your drinks will stay longer.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Have A Gourmet Burger &amp; Hot Dog Bar</strong></h4><p>Set up counters with an assortment of sauces and toppings, and hang a few recipe cards over them so your guests can make their own version of gourmet burgers and hot dogs with different flavours. This will save you from handling requests all night!</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/burger.jpg"><img title = "7 Tips &amp; Tricks To Know For Your Next Backyard Barbeque  7 Tips &amp; Tricks To Know For Your Next Backyard Barbeque  "class="aligncenter wp-image-2584 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/burger.jpg" alt = "savoury meat grill Category:Meats BBQ   savoury meat grill Category:Meats BBQ   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/burger.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/burger-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/burger-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4.

Use Fairy lights</strong></h4><p>If you’re planning for a BBQ at night, you can get strings of fairy lights to wind around the trees in your backyard, or add to the bushes and hedges. If you’re hosting it on your terrace or in your balcony, you can just drape it over the walls or windows.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stairs-lights-abstract-bubbles.jpg"><img title = "7 Tips &amp; Tricks To Know For Your Next Backyard Barbeque  7 Tips &amp; Tricks To Know For Your Next Backyard Barbeque  7 Tips &amp; Tricks To Know For Your Next Backyard Barbeque  "class="alignnone wp-image-2591 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stairs-lights-abstract-bubbles.jpg" alt = "savoury meat grill Category:Meats BBQ   savoury meat grill Category:Meats BBQ   savoury meat grill Category:Meats BBQ   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stairs-lights-abstract-bubbles.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stairs-lights-abstract-bubbles-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stairs-lights-abstract-bubbles-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>6.
