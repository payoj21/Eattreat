8070	This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon & After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly	<p>Going to restaurants to catch up over dinner and drinks on a weeknight has become the norm, off late. Mainly because of the tight schedules that everyone has, and since weekends are more about ‘me’ time instead of ‘we’ time. After Stories Gurgaon is a new restaurant that has opened very close to the IFFCO Chowk Metro Station. It is great for catching up with, especially when you’ve been looking for places near the metro to do so.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>After stories is a micro-brewery that serves North Indian, Continental, and European food. The brewery itself has no particular theme and the overall design of the place is a little confusing since there are so many patterns everywhere.<br />The restaurant is built over three floors, with the full bar in the basement, and the micro-brewery set up on the first floor.The restaurant has the capacity to serve to about 200-250 pax at a time.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>We love seating arrangements near windows for natural light, and so for us the perfect place to sit here was at the first floor near the windows. The place isn’t too crowded on a weekday evening, so one can easily sit here to catch up over drinks and dinner.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697.jpg"><img title = "This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8108" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697.jpg" alt = "Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5697-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The chef brought us an assortment of different vegetarian and non-vegetarian starters for us to sample from and we loved the <strong>Rajma Galouti with the Rajma dip</strong>. The <strong>Dahi stuffed Palak Ke Kebab</strong> was also really nice and soft, and warm, even after we took our own time with the photographs. They also got us <strong>Tawa Meat with crispy bread</strong>, which we loved because the mutton was well done and was flavoured with warm spices. The <strong>Mutton Puff Roll</strong> was encased in a puff pastry which was exactly the right kind of flaky&nbsp;but did not create a mess while we cut through it. We also like the <strong>Baked Chicken Tikka in a Puff Pastry</strong>, which was a lot like quiche.</p><p>For mains, they brought us a plate of <strong>Blueberry Pulao with Lamb Shanks</strong>. This, you have to try as soon as possible. Even if it means that you go all the way to IFFCO Chowk. The lamb was on the bone and was super soft. It owed its flavour and softness to the 8 hours that it had been cooked for, at no more that 75°F. The Blueberry Pulao is great on its own, but is overshadowed by the awesomeness of the lamb. It does give it a slight sweetness, nevertheless.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702.jpg"><img title = "This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8109" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702.jpg" alt = "Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5702-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>They also brought us <strong>Maggi with Mushroom Ragout</strong> <strong>and Feta Cheese Balls</strong>, which we went crazy about because it was just so good. This is probably the only innovation with Maggi’s instant noodles that has impressed us so much. It could do without those feta cheese balls, though. They also got us some <strong>Old Delhi Style Chicken with Khameeri Roti</strong>, which we wanted to polish off but couldn’t because of how full we’d gotten.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733.jpg"><img title = "This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8110" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733.jpg" alt = "Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5733-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We ended our meal with <strong>Churros</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Lemon Curd with a Jaggery Biscotti</strong>. The lemon curd on the biscotti may have been slightly too tangy for our taste, but the Churros were fantastic. We got both kinds&#8211; the <strong>Lunchtime Churros</strong>, which was dressed in a Mustard Mandarin Sauce and Clotted Cream; and the <strong>Dinner Time Churros</strong> which were dressed in a chocolate ganache, raspberry sauce, and clotted cream. They were both so good! The churros looked dense&nbsp;but were extremely light. You should definitely go with your bae to just get the Dinnertime Churros on Valentine’s Day if you’re still confused about what to do.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715.jpg"><img title = "This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  This Lamb Shank Is Probably The Best Dish In Gurgaon &amp; After Stories Is Doing It Perfectly  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8111" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715.jpg" alt = "Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   Indian dinner continental Category:Restaurants casual dining brewery   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5715-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>We loved that all the drinks that we tried were extremely alcoholic in nature. At first, it’ll seem like a normal drink, but you get this boozy aftertaste that makes your eyes widen in surprise. We tried the <strong>Blueberry Smash</strong>, which had a gin base and was flavoured with basil and blueberry; and <strong>Pops Corn</strong>, which had popcorn infused vodka, and corn flakes infused bourbon, with milk and melted chocolate. It looked like a milkshake&nbsp;but tasted nothing like one. We also tried the red and white varieties of their <strong>Black Cherry Sangria</strong>. The fruits were marinated well, and the drink was damn nice. You must get this if you love Sangria as your go-to drink at dinners.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>While we loved most of all that we got, we did find that some of the appetisers that we were served had no unique flavour profile&nbsp;and started tasting similar. The <strong>Crispy Lotus Stems in a Kimchi Caramel Glaze</strong> is something that you may or may not like, depending on whether you like crispy lotus stems. The other items like the <strong>Aloo Vindaloo</strong>, the <strong>Rawa Chicken</strong>, the <strong>Lemon Basil Fish</strong> (although well done) tasted alike after the first bite of each, and we didn’t even have them one after the other.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>If it’s not evident enough, we loved their Blueberry Pulao with Lamb Shanks, and that should be reason enough for you to want to go. Also, the location is quite convenient since it is only a few hundred meters away from the IFFCO Chowk Metro Station. So if you generally travel by the metro instead of braving Gurgaon traffic, you won’t be too far from one. The food here is nice, the drinks are incredibly boozy, the service is very quick and the staff, friendly. That’s pretty much why anyone visits a restaurant, no?</p><p><strong>Head to</strong>&nbsp;SCO 390, Sector 29 Market, Near IFFCO Chowk Metro Station, Gurgaon</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong>&nbsp;097173 33161</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 1,500 for two people (approx)</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AfterStories/?fref=ts" target="_blank">After Stories</a></p>
