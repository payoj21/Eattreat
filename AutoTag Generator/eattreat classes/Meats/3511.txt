3511	The Butter Chicken Kulcha At The Culinary Pitaara Is Just Something Else	<p>Hidden away in Defence Colony, The Culinary Pitaara is this tiny little place that serves up quite a variety of flavourful dishes to its patrons.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>The Culinary Pitaara serves North Indian and Chinese fare out of a small space in Sukhdev Market. It has only recently opened and has quickly gained popularity among the people living in the vicinity.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>Since they barely have any seating arrangements, it is best to order food from here. Whether it’s a full meal that you’re looking for or just appetisers to satisfy hunger pangs, you can either order in or dine in at this small but clean and friendly establishment.</p><p><img title = "The Butter Chicken Kulcha At The Culinary Pitaara Is Just Something Else  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3522" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2898.jpg" alt = "north Indian Defence Colony New Delhi Chinese   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2898.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2898-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2898-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>The Butter Chicken Kulcha is a must try. It comes with a Butter Chicken gravy that&#8217;s well-seasoned and delicious. You will find yourself not being able to stop at just one, or even after you’re full because they taste so good. The <strong>Honey Chilli Lotus Stems</strong>, <strong>Dal Makhanwali</strong>, <strong>Chipotle Murg Tikka</strong>, <strong>Spring Rolls</strong>, and the <strong>Kung Pao Chicken</strong> are all worth a shot too. You should definitely get these when you’re visiting or ordering in.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>While some of their dishes stood apart quite clearly, you can avoid getting the <strong>Sui Mai</strong> and the <strong>Papad Dahi Ke Kebab</strong>, which were both a little soggy.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>All in all, we feel that you should ring up The Culinary Pitaara whenever you have those hunger pangs during the day. The dishes are quite decently priced and the quantities are pretty great too.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theculinarypitaara/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
