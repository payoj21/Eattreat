Apparently, the word &#8220;meat&#8221; has a whole new meaning to it now, than we thought!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>In a secret operation lead by People for Animals (PfA) and the Mumbai Police, it has been discovered that the meat used in biryani is not that of chicken or mutton but of, cats! Gruesome? Well, we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you give up on eating biriyani after thisÂ  shocking revelation.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Crackdown</strong></h4><p>The activities at PfA made a clever ploy to track the miscreants down. They released a video where cats were seen getting abducted, chopped off and used as the meat in roadside biryani stalls after befriending some of the meat sellers. Horrified? Well, wait till you hear of the condition of the rescued cats. The group of 16 cats rescued by the Police, were in a deplorable state. Infested with maggots and dehydrated after not having been fed for days, the cats were induced with trauma and showed aggressive behavior.</p><p>As per the experts, these cats may take a while to recover from the trauma. It is said that the cats were abducted generally from the MTRS station and bus depots, an easy prey for the gypsies. These cats were then drugged and stored in gunny bags. As per Sagar Seth, a volunteer for the rescue team, the cats were sold at INR 100 for a kg as a cheaper replacement of the chicken or mutton. &#8220;A man even ate a raw piece of meat and recommended we try black cat&#8217;s blood,&#8221; Seth added. Just when you thought humanity couldn&#8217;t sink any lower!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></h4><p>A complaint has been registered and the retrieved meat has been sent for testing to detect the presence of the meat of any other animal.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Mukesh Jain/Pixabay</strong></em></p>
