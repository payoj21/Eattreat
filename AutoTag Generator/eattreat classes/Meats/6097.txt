In the beginning, they’re going to start only with these two products but they plan to add more to their retail catalogue in shopping outlets.</p><p>They’ve even got crazy expansion plans that are to take shape in the next three months. They’re introducing the <strong>Barcelos Express</strong> outlets only to malls first. They’re also currently expanding their presence to various cities of the country and only recently opened a 110-seater restaurant in Kolkata. The other outlets are in New Delhi, Gurugram, and Jaipur.</p><p>They plan to open about 6 to 8 more outlets in 2017 in Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Lucknow. These outlets will be a mix of self-owned and franchised operations. They’re also planning to raise funds in March 2018 to meet set targets and will be investing about 12-13 crores to fulfil expansion plans.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Strategies</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/10845624_380193945493923_1547655904682470180_o.jpg"><img title = "Now You Can Make The Barcelos Burgers &amp; Peri Peri Chicken At Home!

All their marketing strategies are based on their research. Since 40% of their total target audience are vegetarians, they had to be inventive with their food that is not only healthy and hygienic but also tasty.</p><p>The Indian palate naturally gravitates towards spicy flavours, and their flame-grilled Peri-Peri dishes on the menu offer just that. They also have different drink and dessert options and have also only recently added fish for their non-vegetarian patrons.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Challenges</strong></h4><p>They’ve tried to offer health food to those with well-travelled taste buds in a casual dining atmosphere. However, they realise that they were dealing with consumers who’re used to having the regular Chinese, Italian, and Indian food.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Being Experimental With Food</strong></h4><p>This South African chain may have faced many challenges initially, but not all in vain. Their Khan Market outlet alone makes about 30-35 lakh a month. Their differently coloured burgers are even being copied by other restaurants. They’re known for their <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Black</strong>, and <strong>White Burgers</strong>, and their <strong>Sangria Bar</strong> that serves 21 different sangrias and boozy shakes are all quite popular.</p><p>Barcelos is working on a brand new menu that will be out in the second week of January. You will see dishes like a <strong>Peri-Peri Pasta</strong> on this new menu.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Expanding Online Presence</strong></h4><p>Once the Barcelos Express outlets are up and running, they’re also going to launch their app by April or May 2017. The app will enable you to book tables in advance and order online. You will also be able to make your own burger, and accrue loyalty points.</p><p><em>Read the full story at <a href="http://www.indiaretailing.com/2016/12/14/food/food-service/sa-chain-barcelos-to-enter-the-retail-space-open-express-outlets-in-malls/" target="_blank">IndiaRetailing</a>.</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Barcelos India</strong></em></p>
