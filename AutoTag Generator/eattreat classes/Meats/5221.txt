5221	We Now Understand The Craze For Baba Chicken From Ludhiana	<p>A venture of Baba Chicken from Ishmeet Chowk, Ludhiana, Baba’s expanded their services to Gurgaon, believing great taste lives on forever and we couldn&#8217;t agree more!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>We fell in love with Baba Chicken at first visit! Scrumptious fare that reminded us of the classic Beera Chicken from Amritsar and classy interiors which will make you want to stay here for more than just a while! (We never realised just how comfortable leather chairs can be until we planted ourselves here.)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>Located next to Porsche showroom on Gold Course Road, they have a peculiarly comfortable, classy yet fun ambience. A small garden on the outside really lifted our mood. So, get a seat right next to the entrance which will give you a good view of the restaurant as well as the garden outside.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p><strong>Masala coke</strong> is their speciality but their <strong>fresh lime soda</strong> is just as good. When you&#8217;re stuffing yourself with so much food, a little fizz becomes necessary!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161128_214917.jpg"><img title = "We Now Understand The Craze For Baba Chicken From Ludhiana  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5330" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161128_214917.jpg" alt = "restaurants north Indian non vegetarian new iconic Category:Restaurants   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161128_214917.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161128_214917-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161128_214917-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em> Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Srishty Khullar</strong></em></p><p>We were absolutely elated to discover just how juicy their tikkas are! Beginning with <strong>kali mirch chicken tikka</strong> and <strong>malai tikka</strong>, we relished each bite. Caramelised outside, soft and juicy inside, they were perfectly cooked and flavoured. Since it&#8217;s winters, we couldn&#8217;t miss out on fish. Comes on the table beautifully crumbed and <strong>fried fish</strong>, flaky on the inside and unbelievably crispy outside, with no oil dripping whatsoever! While the <strong>tawa chicken</strong> was also delicious, we especially enjoyed the unconventional <strong>kali mirch butter chicken</strong>. Pair it with <strong>garlic naan</strong> and we promise, you will walk out happy as a clam!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>We didn&#8217;t particularly enjoy the <strong>tartar dip</strong> served with fried fish, it was quite sweet and not thick enough. A good dip would have amplified the dish multifold. The <strong>gulab jamun</strong> wasn’t great either. Its best to steer clear of their dessert section.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought </strong></h4><p>Overall, we are in love with Baba Chicken! Cancelling our pending Ludhiana plans, we will simply head here whenever we craving some good food (which is almost always)!</p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/babachickengurgaon/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Representational Photo Courtesy Of:<strong> Pixabay</strong></em></p>
