6794	Instant Japanese? Calm Your Seafood Cravings With Meatigo’s Tempura Prawns	<p>Meatigo has launched their signature range of ready-to-eat seafood dishes. They&#8217;ve made it incredibly easy to order seafood online. You just need to take them out of the freezer, pop them in an air fryer or simply fry them, and you’re done! We feel that it’s just the thing to get on those days when you have a craving for seafood, or you suddenly have company over. Here are three things you should get from Meatigo when those cravings got you twitchy and restless.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Japanese Tempura Battered Prawns</strong></h4><p>This is the first time anyone has launched a Japanese cook-at-home range in India. The prawns are fully cooked, but only need air frying or deep frying before you can serve them. The prawns themselves don’t have a particularly fish-like taste and are pretty big. The tempura batter is light, lightly seasoned, and does not make a mess while you’re eating it.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Sprinkle a little wasabi powder to add to that Japanese taste. You can also have this with a little mayonnaise.</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 825 for 500 gm (15 pieces)</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Untitled-design-12.png"><img title = "Instant Japanese?

The prawns are covered in this thin layer of lightly seasoned egg wash and bread and just need to be deep fried before serving. The prawn cutlets are juicy and succulent, but one needs to be careful about cooking time since they can very easily be overcooked.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Have this with a Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce.</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 975 for 500 gm (18-20 pieces).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Classic Fish Fingers</strong></h4><p>They claim that these fish fingers will be a hit with anyone who loves fish, and we couldn’t help but agree. They’ve got a nice, beautiful crunchy crust around a flavourful fish. Don’t fry for too long, or they’ll become like matchsticks in no time.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Have this with Tartare Sauce.</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 415 for 500 gm.</p><p>None of these come with sauces, so you should either get some from your neighbourhood grocery store or make some at home. However, we hear that they will also be coming up with their own range of Japanese sauces and dips to make a perfect pairing with all the seafood. Also, the cooking instructions are written on the packet and available on the FB page, so don&#8217;t forget to read those before getting started with the cooking.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Meatigo/" target="_blank">Meatigo</a>.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Meatigo</strong></em></p><hr /><p>This article is in partnership with<strong> Meatigo</strong>. #Sponsored</p>
