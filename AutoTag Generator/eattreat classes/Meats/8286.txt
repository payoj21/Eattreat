8286	Changezi Chicken In Daryaganj Makes The Spiciest Chicken Dish In Town	<p><strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong> makes sure that they make their way to every outstanding eatery and give us an inside. This time they even checked out Changezi Chicken Purani Dilli. Read on to bookmark this spot for eternity.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Famous for its Mughlai and Tandoori dishes, Changezi Chicken &nbsp;is a non vegetarian’s arcadia. Located on Netaji Subhash Marg, this small restaurant serves outstanding food. Though they don’t have much for vegetarians, but for the non veggies, this is Shangri La!&nbsp;I had heard a lot about the place, and the week before, I decided to visit the place for dinner. It is a small air conditioned restaurant which was established around 12 years back according to the owner, Mr. Mohd. Salman.</p><h4><strong>The Menu</strong></h4><p>As the name of the restaurant suggests, the menu is chicken-centric, with only a few other options, but that does not make it any less enticing.&nbsp; We began with the <strong>Afghani Chicken,</strong> which is chicken marinated in curd and other spices and then roasted. It is then put in gravy of cream and butter. This Afghani chicken is had with onions and coriander chutney. The chicken pieces were succulent and soft. They were properly marinated and the flavours had touched the core of the piece. The gravy was equally tasty and smooth.</p><p>We had also ordered<a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/best-butter-chicken-in-delhi/"><strong> Butter Chicken</strong> </a>which arrived soon with the <strong>rumali roti</strong>. The proportion of tomatoes, cream and spices was perfect in the dish, but the rumali roti was not such a hit. It was not very hot when served and it became rubbery and stretchy soon.&nbsp;</p><p>And the showstopper of the evening was of course the most special dish of the restaurant; the <strong>Changezi Chicken</strong>. This is a great getaway from the usual chicken dishes. The grilled chicken pieces in the curry are first marinated&nbsp;<br />in lime juice and spices and then grilled. They are later served in gravy. Initially, one might find it a little sour, but gradually your taste buds will love it. It’s garnished with freshly chopped coriander leaves and served hot with&nbsp;<strong>khamiri roti&nbsp;</strong>or plain naan. The dish has a little crunch in it and tanginess. It’s aptly spiced and served.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What&#8217;s For Dessert?</strong></h4><p>For the dessert we had <strong>zafrani kheer</strong>. It is basically the normal kheer to which zafran (saffron) is added. This adds further flavour, colour and fragrance to the sweet dish. It was served cold and tasted incredible. After all the spice, the little sugar made a perfect ending to the perfect dinner.</p><p>The service is really impressive in the eatery. Despite the renovation that is on in the place, the staff ensures proper check on the customer’s requirement and comfort.</p><h4><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>For all those looking out for inexpensive and delicious non vegetarian food this weekend, do try out the place. Even a <a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/theory-of-butter-chicken-marryam-h-reshii/">full plate of butter chicken </a>will not cost more than 500 bucks. The place is great for family meals or an outing with friends. It’s comfortable (not luxurious) and gives you the feel of having good food in the heart of Delhi. After the feast, you can take a walk to the famous Jama Masjid to digest the scrumptious meal.</p><p>A meal for two would only cost around 400 &#8211; 500 bucks. My personal recommendation would be the Afghani Chicken and certainly the Chicken Changezi!</p><p><strong>Head to&nbsp;</strong><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35483">3614, N.S.Marg,&nbsp;</span><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35484">Daryaganj</span><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35485">, New Delhi</span></p><p><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35488"><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35489"><strong>Say hello</strong> at&nbsp;</span><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35490">011 23275275,&nbsp;</span><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35491">+91 9716028080,&nbsp;9312251239</span></span></p><p><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35494"><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35495"><a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/changezi/">Pay </a>INR&nbsp;500 for two people&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35498"><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35499">Explore</span><span id="m_-1881809868568912668yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487322604710_35500">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CHANGEZICHICKEN/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Changezi Chicken</a></span></span></p><p><em>This article first appeared on the <a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/changezi/" target="_blank"><strong>Delhi Food Walks Blog by Kashish Badar</strong></a>.</em></p>
