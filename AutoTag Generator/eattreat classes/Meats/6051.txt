6051	Let The Mystery Of World-Renowned Curries Unfold At Piali Curry Bistro	<p>In a city booming with caf√©s and restaurants playing loud music and experimenting with nitrogen and molecular mixology, Piali- The Curry Bistro stands out as a place where one can go to get a taste of the familiar (for eg. Chicken Curry, yum).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Piali is a 50-seater restaurant that speaks of class in every inch of the space. They believe that at the end of the day, we only come back to food that comforts us the most. And what&#8217;s better than curry flavours from around the world to do that for us?</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>The best place to sit here is near the windows overlooking the busy streets. Although, if you&#8217;re here with family you might want to sit in the lounge area.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>We got the <strong>Kala Khatta Cocktail</strong> which is one of their signatures. It&#8217;s exactly what the name sounds like and reminds you of a time when one indulged in <strong>Kala Khatta Golas</strong>. In case you&#8217;re not sure if you want a boozy cocktail, you should get the gig and chocolate shake. You can taste the sweet nuttiness of the figs in every sip.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We got the <strong>Jaffna Black Pepper Curry Leaf Prawns</strong>, and we were surprised as to how well cooked they were. The <strong>Daab Chingri</strong>&nbsp;was cooked to perfection and the&nbsp;<strong>Assamese Black Sesame Chicken Curry</strong>&nbsp;was different from the regular kind of chicken curry that we&#8217;re used to having. The <strong>Tea Country Pork Curry</strong> from Sri Lanka was delicious and perfectly seasoned. But, we were blown away by the <strong>Martaban Meat</strong>&#8211;the mutton was well cooked and it practically fell off the bone. The flavour from the kalonji was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Get the <strong>Pineapple Halwa</strong> if you&#8217;re looking to end your meal on a sweet note. We recommend that you take your time with this one and let the flavours burst in your mouth.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>While the food was great and the service, quick; the <strong>Sweet Corn Soup</strong> that we got wasn&#8217;t already seasoned. But that&#8217;s not that big a deal because you can always add salt and pepper to your liking anyway.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Piali&nbsp;is one of those few places that one can go to if curry is what comfort food means to you. The best part is, all the dishes come with accompaniments. So, if you need anything extra, you can always get that. The portions are also quite sufficient for two.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pialicp/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: </em><strong><em>Piali&nbsp;&#8211; The Curry Bistro</em></strong></p>
