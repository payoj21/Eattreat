7766	Kebab Gali Brings You Dozens Of Different Kebabs For You To Drool Over	<p>Thank the medieval Turkish soldiers&nbsp; for being the first people, all those centuries ago, to have come up with the idea of kebabs! Now, fast forward to the modern day and here we have Kebab Gali New Delhi, a quaint little restaurant serving a plethora of, well no surprise there, kebabs! <a href="http://kunalkhurana.com/kebab-gali/?bw" target="_blank">Kunal Khurana takes us to this spot</a>, which is doing some amazing stuff:</p><h4><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Having been invited to a bloggers’ meet at one of their branches (Malviya Nagar) couple of days earlier, I got a first-hand experience of some of their delicacies &amp; without keeping any suspense I should say they were outstanding!&nbsp;But let’s have a comprehensive view first. The restaurant’s location at Corner Market, Malviya Nagar is somewhat tricky to notice at the first go, being sandwiched among other establishments but once you enter it is comparatively quiet &amp; absolutely welcoming for oneself.</p><h4><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>There is seating arrangement for about 30 people, give or take, so it’s not, strictly speaking, a BIG place. However, that’s one thing that I personally like in an eatery because in my experience, the bigger the place the lesser they give attention to details. But of course, exceptions are always there.</p><p>Now coming back to the topic, there is ample lighting which gets a big thumbs up from me and the decor is apt according to the theme. The staff and most importantly, the owner (who was present during the bloggers’ meet) was absolutely forthcoming and helpful in every way. He also gave a brief description of how each dish is prepared in their kitchen &amp; how they make their own blend of secret spices! Tell you the truth, getting to know all these details really fired up my taste buds &amp; made every dish seem like all the more delicious.</p><h4><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o.jpg"><img title = "Kebab Gali Brings You Dozens Of Different Kebabs For You To Drool Over  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7797" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o.jpg" alt = "restaurants north Indian meats Indian Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12370804_10153668467390239_8289703798801085664_o-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The very first dish we started with was <strong>Chicken Garlic Tikka.</strong>&nbsp;At first glance you may think it’s only <strong>Chicken Malai Tikka</strong> but wait till you taste it and you will notice the subtle difference that a whiff of garlic can make! Another thing to be said here and that goes for every single dish that rolled out in front of me, was that the plating and presentation was always spot on. And deserves to be mentioned separately.</p><p>Then came the <strong>Shikhampuri Kebab</strong> which were as much a delight to the tummy as they were to the eyes! Such perfect eclipses of food goodness, I tell you!&nbsp;The next dish that came out really had me amazed &amp; in awe; it was the <strong>Chicken Chapli Kebab</strong>. Such tender pieces of spiced meat that the moment you pick them up they just crumble then and there. I think I almost finished the whole plate by myself!</p><p>This was followed by <strong>Galouti Kebab</strong> that came on top of neatly cut pieces of <strong>Warqi Paranthas</strong>. Personally, I am not a fan of this style of kebabs, as I find them too malleable but that doesn’t take away the fact that they were cooked to perfection.&nbsp;Next came the <strong>Dohra Kebab</strong>. They are called so because they are actually mutton kebabs that are wrapped around with a layering of <strong>Chicken Kebabs</strong> thereby given double the taste from two varieties of meat together.</p><p>I also got myself the <strong>Mutton Nihari</strong> which was decent enough, before settling down for <strong>Chicken Biryani</strong> towards the last leg of the meal to wind up things on a grand note.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o.jpg"><img title = "Kebab Gali Brings You Dozens Of Different Kebabs For You To Drool Over  Kebab Gali Brings You Dozens Of Different Kebabs For You To Drool Over  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7798" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o.jpg" alt = "restaurants north Indian meats Indian Category:Meats   restaurants north Indian meats Indian Category:Meats   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12362813_10153669318220239_4033266466625946780_o-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>As for the need of satisfying the sweet tooth, I tasted the extra-sweet <strong>Shahi Tukda</strong> &amp; also the <strong>Gulab Jamun</strong>.
