4406	Go Cruelty-Free & Animal-Friendly With Allnut’s Cold-Pressed Nut Milks	<p>We are loving the fresh and natural nut milks that Allnut provides for those looking for an alternative to standard milks and for those who have an unfortunate intolerance. Dietary issues are now a part of our lifestyle and Allnut is making a difference by giving you options in dairy.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Sakshi Khanna Hari and the Allnut team started milking almonds in 2012, but only in August 2015, did the whole idea come together and operations began. Starting with small batches, the team promised to deliver fresh milk to your doorstep. The love for this probably came from their dedication to health and whole foods, and if you&#8217;re prone to intolerances or harmful imbalances, then Allnut is all you need.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Flavouring Your Life</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11915678_135837173425588_8116852384983015428_n.jpg"><img title = "Go Cruelty-Free &amp; Animal-Friendly With Allnut&#039;s Cold-Pressed Nut Milks  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4435" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11915678_135837173425588_8116852384983015428_n.jpg" alt = "vegetarian vegan Organic Milk healthy drinks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11915678_135837173425588_8116852384983015428_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11915678_135837173425588_8116852384983015428_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11915678_135837173425588_8116852384983015428_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Started with just almonds and certain flavours, they are currently planing to add more nuts to their repository. We hear that preservative free pistachio,  cashew, hazelnut, coconut milks and butters are coming. You can try their unsweetened versions as well or the vegan options of coconut sugar or raw sugar. Their current flavours include Cacao, Vanilla, Basil and Cinnamon. Activated almonds to begin the day? Yes yes yes.</p><p>We also think that it&#8217;s a good idea to go in for the chia seeds with this to derive the maximum nutrition for this.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dairy-very</strong></h4><p>Delivery across NCR, they promise to deliver this your doorstep and you can even order in packs so that you don&#8217;t miss out on this ever.
