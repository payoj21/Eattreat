6362	Getafix Does Healthy Fish & Chips And Obviously That Is All We Need	<p><strong>Chatpati Diary</strong> recently visited Getafix in Greater Kailash market, and we happily tagged along. Here&#8217;s what we found.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>There are way too many cafes in the market these days which claim themselves to be serving healthy/organic/guilt free food but how many out of all those are worth trying is the question. Getafix, claims nothing out of all these characteristics. They simply serve you what they would want to have without feeling guilty, of course they have kept taste and options in mind, so that they don’t bore the customers with repetitive stuff.</p><p>With teal color brick walls one one side and a small book shelf at the entrance, this place will make you fall in love with itself as soon as you enter. At least, it did made us fall in love with it. The music is another highlight apart from food. The owners Dhruv and Aanandita have got some amazing taste in both music and food.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>Getafix has a lot to offer you, from choice of pancakes to omelettes and appetizers to freshly made pastas and pizzas. To start with, we ordered <strong>pancakes with banana and honey</strong>. Dhruv, the founder of the cafe told me the story behind these pancakes. So initially they did 30%  whole wheat and 70% oats but it didn’t come out as expected and as they just cannot compromise on the taste part, they decided to find a way out and came up with this unique way of making thin pancakes and filling it with ricotta and nuts and the choice of topping/filling you wanted. Our verdict- these pancakes are simply refreshing than your usual fluffy pancakes which eventually become heavy on your stomach. They serve the pancakes with 3 dips, honey, maple syrup and fruit compote. A must-have!</p><p>You always thought of having smoothies but couldn’t, because the ingredients and look of it was enough to fill you with dread? Well if that&#8217;s the case then try the smoothies here and we bet you’ll come for more next time. The cafe has an extensive menu of juices and smoothies, all being freshly prepared with seasonal fruits.</p><p>They do have some options which might contain canned pulp or fruits but they do not appreciate it and hence, they have variety of seasonal fruits to interchange with the existing option in a particular smoothie or juice. We opted for <strong>Berranana Fix</strong> and <strong>Khal Strawgo Fix</strong>. Berranana Fix has banana, blueberries, raspberries, strawberry and yoghurt and Khal Stawgo fix has got mango, strawberry, basil and yoghurt. As they do not suggest using non-seasonal fruits, so the mango was changed to kiwi and trust us, each of them tasted better than the other.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Try These Too!</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15110502_1692387877756440_6108256539136939239_o.jpg"><img title = "Getafix Does Healthy Fish &amp; Chips And Obviously That Is All We Need  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6367" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15110502_1692387877756440_6108256539136939239_o.jpg" alt = "snacks healthy food healthy greater kailash new delhi Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15110502_1692387877756440_6108256539136939239_o.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15110502_1692387877756440_6108256539136939239_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15110502_1692387877756440_6108256539136939239_o-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15110502_1692387877756440_6108256539136939239_o-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>After my fix of smoothies and pancake, We ordered <strong>Air fried fish and chips</strong> and <strong>Mexican Bowl</strong>. Brilliant in taste, perfectly cooked and almost zero oil. The food here is neither too spicy nor bland because we know after hearing the word ‘Healthy’ most of us associate with the word ‘Bland’ or ‘Tasteless’ but Getafix will change your mindset and notion about healthy food being tasteless, as every dish here is as tasty as any other oily, heavy dish or maybe better.</p><p>The <strong>Mexican bowl</strong> has, steamed vegetable mexican rice with grilled veggies, black beans and salsa style sauce. Another filling dish which is not at all heavy and perfectly balanced in terms of flavour.</p><p>Last but not the least, our meals are incomplete without having desserts, so we decided to go for <strong>Diet Vanilla Pound cake</strong> and yet again, we weren&#8217;t disappointed at all. The lovely people at Getafix packed us a slice of <strong>carrot cake</strong> as well which was another surprise. After carrying it for good 1 hour and another half hour of delay, we finally ate it and now it’s added to our list of best carrot cakes in Delhi.</p><p>All in all, we had the best experience ever without feeling the side-order of guilt we usually do after gorging on delish food!</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href="https://chatpatidiary.wordpress.com/2015/11/15/getafix-guilt-free-indulgence-newintown/" target="_blank">Chatpati Diary</a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of <strong>Getafix</strong></em></p>
