The flavour is quite strong in the first steep, but though the packaging says that you can steep it a couple more times, we wouldn’t recommend it. We absolutely loved the aroma and the tea detox capabilities of this one. You can also pick out their <strong>Himalayan Green Tea</strong>, <strong>Himalayan Rose Tea</strong> and <strong>Hand-Rolled Oolong Tea</strong>.
