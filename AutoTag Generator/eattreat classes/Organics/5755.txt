5755	A Hauz Khas Village Food Trail For Your Weekday Pampering In One Go	<p><strong>Swiggy</strong> took us on a food trail through the busy lanes of Hauz Khas Village, and came back with a tummy full of food and pleasant surprises. We covered four HKV establishments – Wai Wai City, Maquina, Masha and The Village Deck (All that food in one sunny winter afternoon, sigh)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wai Wai City</strong></h4><p>Our first stop was Wai Wai City – a young noodle station that’s easy to find as you enter the Village. What’s different about this noodle bar? Well, for starters, you can choose from 7 preset wai-wai noodle bowls, like <strong>Bangkok Express</strong> (this one has Classic noodles, Thai Spicy Basil Sauce and veggies) or <strong>Pow Chow</strong> (Pan fried noodles tossed with Garlic Soya Oyster Sauce and veggies). You can add on chicken if you’d like. What we loved was the ‘make your own Wai-Wai’ option. You can pick your own noodles – Classic, Roasted, Pan Fried or Crunchy, Your own sauce – Chilli Garlic, Masala Fusion, Kung Pao and more (there’s 7 in all), your own vegetables and other toppings. We also loved their <strong>Wai-Wai Bhel</strong>, which is a must try if you lean towards crispy and spicy.</p><p>Follow Wai Wai City <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WaiWaiCity/" target="_blank">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Maquina</strong></h4><p>A few steps further, we hopped over to Maquina for their mocktails and small plates. We tried their <strong>Oreo Shake</strong> (a little too milky for our liking), <strong>Mixed berry shake</strong> and <strong>Hazelnut frappe</strong>. From their food menu, we sampled their <strong>Beer Battered Onion Rings</strong> (crisp to perfection) and<strong> Mozarella Medallion</strong> (Cheesy and spicy). We liked the ambience, you can sit by large open windows and sip on your mocktail. The indoor seating is very dimly lit, but overlooks a well-designed bar.</p><p>Follow Maquina <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaquinaHKV/" target="_blank">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Masha</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/masha.jpg"><img title = "A Hauz Khas Village Food Trail For Your Weekday Pampering In One Go  "class="alignnone wp-image-5757 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/masha.jpg" alt = "healthy food hauz khas village Category:Organics Biryani   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/masha.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/masha-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/masha-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Next stop on our food trail was Masha, which blew us away with the lake view! Masha is perfect for those seeking a quiet evening with their companion, by the lake with drinks and some Turkish or North Indian fare. At Masha, we tried their <strong>Veg Shammi</strong>, which practically melted in our mouths. We sampled their <strong>Chicken Biryani</strong>, also done well. From their selection of mocktails, we liked their version of <strong>Virgin Pina Colada</strong> and <strong>Watermelon Mojito</strong>.</p><p>Follow Masha <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mashahkv/" target="_blank">here</a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Village Deck</strong></h4><p>We made our way, stomachs almost full, to The Village Deck. With an al-fresco seating, and a view of the village, The Village Deck scored well on food and ambience. While downstairs they have a DJ, upstairs the sitting area is quiet and idyllic for a brunch. While here, you can try their<strong> Butter Chicken</strong> (creamy, tangy and just the right amount of buttery goodness), <strong>Mutton Rogan Josh</strong> (the mutton was well done, and the curry wasn’t much like a typical Rogan Josh but we liked it nonetheless) and <strong>Dal Tadka</strong>. We also ordered their mixed sauce pasta, which didn’t find favour with us.</p><p>Follow The Village Deck <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevillagedeck/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a></p><p>We had a very busy afternoon, gorging on food and taking in the sights and sounds of Hauz Khas Village, which for all its lost glory is still a popular hangout joint for youngsters in the city. We hope to head there again for another food trail, very soon and stuff ourselves silly.</p>
