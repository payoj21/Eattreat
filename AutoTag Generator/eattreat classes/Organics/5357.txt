5357	Amazon Go Brings Their First Fully-Automated Brick & Mortar Offline Store	<p>Lenskart did it, Mobile Store did it and now, Amazon has done it. And how. Providing a seamless buying experience for patrons across mediums and channels, Amazon Go is one of the first few brick and mortar fully-automated grocery stores in the world and has opened in Seattle, USA.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers pick up the items they want from the shelves, the sensors detect the price of the items and the bill is straightaway sent to the Amazon account of the customer. The 1800 square feet store, Amazon Go, is going to give a stiff competition to the big supermart players already in the market. Right on Target, eh?</span></p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NrmMk1Myrxc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat to supermarket chains”, points out Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. Interestingly, when Amazon announced its brick and mortar grocery store, its shares rose 2.6%, while that of S&amp;P food retail index, which includes Kroger Co and other leading food companies, fell 0.5%. All we can say is bye bye long queues. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Go is currently opening the grocery store only for its own employees. It will run tests for around a year, before it is opened to the public. The Wall Street Journal reported that if these tests are successful, there will be 2,000 more outlets operating soon.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>No Mo Queues</strong></h4><p>&#8220;The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,&#8221; said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. &#8220;Not only would you save a lot on labour costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.&#8221;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Go is not the first brick and mortar store of the company. It has a bookstore and a lot of kindle stores spread throughout the United States. We hope that the company brings this venture to India as well, where queues are the biggest problem.</span></p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/amazon-opens-line-free-grocery-store-in-challenge-to-supermarkets-1634642" target="_blank">here</a>. </em></p>
