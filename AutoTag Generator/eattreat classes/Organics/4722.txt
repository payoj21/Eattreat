4722	#EatEffect // Your Starter Kit To Starting Your Own Kitchen Garden	<p>You know as well as we do that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to start or maintain even a tiny kitchen garden, what with the lack of space and everything. But, we’re telling you everything you need to know so you can brighten up your balconies and terraces so you can do your bit for an #EatEffect.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Find A Well-Lit Spot</strong></h4><p>It is imperative that your plants get ample sunlight so they grow well and healthy. Pick a spot for your kitchen garden that gets about 3-4 hours of sunlight on a daily basis. It could be a balcony, your terrace, or a windowsill.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Recycle Small Containers</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Microgreens.jpg"><img title = "#EatEffect // Your Starter Kit To Starting Your Own Kitchen Garden  "class="alignnone wp-image-4725 size-full" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Microgreens.jpg" alt = "Organic Kitchen ingredients homemade healthy chef Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Microgreens.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Microgreens-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Microgreens-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If you don’t want to invest in big pots or don’t have space for them, you can always recycle small containers to plant herbs and microgreens. This way you’ll have a manageable setup, and you’ll be reducing your carbon footprint by recycling those containers that you were going to throw away.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Get The Right Nutrient-Rich Soil</strong></h4><p>It’s very important for you to use soil that is a mixture of regular soil, coco peat or sand, and vermicompost. Don’t forget to replenish the soil with nutrients after the monsoon, as it tends to get washed away.</p><p>Additionally, you can use sugarcane bagasse that you can procure from your neighbourhood sugarcane juice vendor, or crushed dry leaves to mix with the soil to enrich your kitchen garden.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Selecting The Seeds / Saplings</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chive-Flowers.jpg"><img title = "#EatEffect // Your Starter Kit To Starting Your Own Kitchen Garden  #EatEffect // Your Starter Kit To Starting Your Own Kitchen Garden  "class="alignnone wp-image-4724 size-full" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chive-Flowers.jpg" alt = "Organic Kitchen ingredients homemade healthy chef Category:Organics   Organic Kitchen ingredients homemade healthy chef Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chive-Flowers.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chive-Flowers-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chive-Flowers-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>You should pick your seeds depending on what use you have for them. You could pick culinary herbs like basil, dill, mint, rosemary, thyme, or tarragon, or even edible flowers to make those plates look pretty! Keep in mind, however, the amount of time and care that it takes to grow each of them.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Water Them Regularly</strong></h4><p>Water your plants regularly and only the required measure for them to grow. Remember, watering them too many times a day is not going to make them grow faster.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Be Patient</strong></h4><p>Patience is a virtue, and for good reason. It may take months before you start getting desired results and the wait can make you want to give up. But just a little patience can go a long way and can get you the fruits of your labour, quite literally!</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>VisualHunt</strong></em></p><hr /><p>This article is part of the EatTreat campaign to eat better and live more consciously.
