4582	An #EatEffect Analysis // Which Healthy Diet Works Best For You	<p>A healthy diet means different things for different people. The current environmental conditions are forcing people to change their diets and become more environmentally conscious while making their food selections. And hence, <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//eateffect-greenisthenewblack-eat-green/">#EatEffect</a>. Here is a list of top diets trending worldwide and why we think you should pick one that works perfectly for you.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vegan Diets</strong></h4><p>While it’s extremely popular, most people don&#8217;t realise what it means. Along with being vegetarian, it includes saying bye to all animal products and by-products like eggs, milk, dairy, honey, butter and cheese (though vegan cheese is now available)!</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Veganism is currently the most trending diet of all. And since #GreenIsTheNewBlack, people all around the world are opting for this healthy diet as part of their green campaign to support the environment.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> This diet is extremely technical because most products contain hidden ingredients indirectly derived from animal produce, like whey or casein. While it is great for the environment, vegan diets can leave you more susceptible to nutrient deficiencies, specially for omega-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin D and B12.</p><p>If you are vegan and the diet works for you, its great; but if you are thinking of trying it out, beware! You will have to go the extra mile to enforce it and even more to consume the nutrients required by your body to maintain your strength.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vegetables-1403046_1920.jpg"><img title = "An #EatEffect Analysis // Which Healthy Diet Works Best For You  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4600" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vegetables-1403046_1920.jpg" alt = "vegetarian vegan Organic healthy gluten-free Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vegetables-1403046_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vegetables-1403046_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vegetables-1403046_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gluten-Free Diets</strong></h4><p>Gluten is a mix of proteins found in grains. Many people are allergic to gluten or suffer from celiac disease and thus, need to adapt a gluten-free diet.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Followed by many celebrities it is now trending with more and more people adapting this diet for health reasons and to lose weight. Any food made with wheat or other gluten-containing grains needs to be avoided, including breads, beer, cakes, candies, pies, french fries, pasta and processed meats. You can eat food which is naturally gluten-free like eggs, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> However, every person reacts to the diet differently and while some might feel better with this change, others could possibly have a negative effect and would be advised to reverse the diet by eating more grains.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra </strong>Studies show it is best suited for those with celiac disease and its benefits to those who adapt this as a life-style change are not very significant.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Eat What You Like Diet</strong></h4><p>We have been on a see-food (eat what you see) diet for a long time, but to switch things up and take a healthy turn we are now on eat what you like healthy diet. (Yes, we made it up but it works wonders!) We still eat when we like and when we like but with a few simple changes and precautions.</p><p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> If it’s not delicious, why waste your calories on it! No longer do we eat food which tastes just average or below average (though we are guilty of eating things we don&#8217;t like before, but no longer)!</p><p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Timings! Slowly we have set our body on food timings. We eat a heavy breakfast at 8:30am, lunch at 1:30pm and dinner at 7:30pm. While we don&#8217;t limit our quantities or restrict what we are eating, making this simple change has really made a difference.</p><p><strong>Rule 3:</strong> Include simple things which contain nutrients! We have included 5 almonds, 1 teaspoon flaxseed powder and a cup of green tea in our everyday routine with ease and it has worked beautifully. Eating almonds and ground flaxseeds in the morning energises us for the day and the evening green tea helps us rejuvenate before taking on more work.</p><p><strong>Rule 4:</strong> Eat Organic! We have made <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//eat-effect-i-say-organic-healthy-ingredients/">I Say Organic</a> our best friend for everyday meals. It’s a very simple change because we are still eating the same things but it has a better effect on the environment and our body.</p><p><b>#EatExtra:</b> A thorough research, opinions from people following the diet and doctor consultations are highly recommended before making a healthy diet change.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><hr /><p>This article is part of the EatTreat campaign to eat better and live more consciously.
