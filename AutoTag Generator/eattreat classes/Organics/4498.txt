4498	#EatEffect // 3 Simple Ways To Include Chia Seeds In A Detox Diet	<p>In the spirit of the <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//eateffect-greenisthenewblack-eat-green/">#EatEffect</a>, we’re telling you how you can add chia seeds—this seemingly small ingredient to boost your well-being that is higher in Omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, rich in fibre, and is a great antioxidant—in 3 simple ways to help you eat better. Especially when it comes to a detox diet.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chia Pudding</strong></h4><p>For a <a href="http://(http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//get-healthy-not-broke-paleo-on-a-budget/)" target="_blank">paleo</a> version, pour in two cups of coconut milk and ½ cup of chia seeds in a jam jar. Keep refrigerated overnight and have it for breakfast or take it on the go.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> You could alternatively top it with grated coconut or honey, or load it with berries for a dessert version.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chia Yogurt</strong></h4><p>Give your snack a quick Omega-3 punch by mixing fruits with your cup of yoghurt and topping it with a teaspoon full of crushed chia seeds for that extra crunch.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> You could do this with flavoured or greek yoghurt too, in case you&#8217;re planning for a detox diet!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Strawberry Chia Jam</strong></h4><p>In a vessel put in 4 cups of hulled and chopped strawberries, and ¼ cup of chia seeds. Add a ¼ cup of 100% apple juice it and simmer for 25 minutes, or just until the fruit starts releasing its juices and breaking down. Mash well till it gets a puree like consistency. Cool and store in jars, and refrigerate. The jam thickens because of the chia seeds. You can use this on your choice of bread—toasted or as is, or with some really great grilled cheese.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> You can use any other berry to make the jam. If you want an even sweeter version, you can use a ¼ cup of maple syrup instead of apple juice.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p><hr /><p>This article is part of the EatTreat campaign to eat better and live more consciously.
