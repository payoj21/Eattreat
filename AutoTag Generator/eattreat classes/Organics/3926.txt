3926	The Different Types Of Honey That You Probably Didn’t Know Existed	<p>The single question we get asked the most is, “How do you get different flavours of honey?” and the answer is – it all depends on where the bees buzz. Yes! The bees are responsible for this. They have to feed on a specific plant to render honey with unique flavours. Also, the colour of these different flavours of honey ranges from nearly colourless to dark brown.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>Remember this general rule, light-coloured honey is milder in taste and dark-coloured honey is stronger. The flavour &amp; the colour of the honey differs depending on the nectar source (the flowers) visited by honey bees, and there are more than 300 unique types of honey available. Hard to believe, right?</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Blueberry Honey</strong></h4><p>The slight tangy &amp; fruity flavour of the blueberry honey is so good that many people believe that it is not natural but flavoured. Well, that’s not true! Blueberry Honey is created from the nectar that the bees have gathered from blueberry and cranberry blossoms.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Buckwheat Honey</strong></h4><p>Compared with lighter-coloured varieties, buckwheat honey isn’t as sweet in taste. You’ll be amazed to know that the basic composition and nutritional profile of all types of honey are more or less similar but buckwheat honey has a little extra to offer. An increasing body of scientific research suggests that this dark-coloured, strongly- flavoured superfood has a number of interesting health benefits, including cough suppression and antioxidant protection.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Avocado Honey </strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honeybee_Apis_mellifera_pollinating_Avocado_cv.jpg"><img title = "The Different Types Of Honey That You Probably Didn&#039;t Know Existed  "alt = "Organic online Honey healthy   "class="alignnone wp-image-3945 size-full" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honeybee_Apis_mellifera_pollinating_Avocado_cv.jpg" width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honeybee_Apis_mellifera_pollinating_Avocado_cv.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honeybee_Apis_mellifera_pollinating_Avocado_cv-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Honeybee_Apis_mellifera_pollinating_Avocado_cv-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p><p>Of course, we know that you love your guacamole, but trust us Avocado Honey is no less amazing. Avocado honey comes from the avocado blossom’s nectar. It is dark amber in colour and feels smooth and silky on the tongue. We personally think that it is an excellent substitute for maple syrup.<br />Try dunking a piece of hot cornbread or a biscuit into a bowl of avocado honey whipped with butter for a simple but comforting treat. It is equally delicious over fresh cut juicy fruits, salty nuts and smooth, smoky cheeses.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Orange Blossom</strong></h4><p>If you enjoy eating orange blossom honey for its unique and delicate flavours, you will be pleased to know that it’s more than just a sweet treat. Orange blossom honey, like many other honey varieties, has medicinal properties that support human health and well-being and can be used both internally and externally.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Litchi Honey</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14650556_1834585270161277_545664465087566991_n.jpg"><img title = "The Different Types Of Honey That You Probably Didn&#039;t Know Existed  The Different Types Of Honey That You Probably Didn&#039;t Know Existed  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3944" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14650556_1834585270161277_545664465087566991_n.jpg" alt = "Organic online Honey healthy   Organic online Honey healthy   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14650556_1834585270161277_545664465087566991_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14650556_1834585270161277_545664465087566991_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14650556_1834585270161277_545664465087566991_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Honey Twigs</strong></em></p><p>Litchi Honey is our favourite of all the different types of honey.
