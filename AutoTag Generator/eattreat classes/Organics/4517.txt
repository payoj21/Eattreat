Flax seeds are going to be your new best friend this season and we’ll tell you how to feel light and lovely the next few months.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First </strong></p><p>Flax seeds are small wonders, commonly known to reduce bad cholesterols and protect against cancer and heart diseases. But that’s not all! These almost-magical brown and golden seeds are also great for your health and this is how:</p><p><strong>Hair:</strong><b> </b>Loaded with Omega-3 fatty acids (who cares what they are, but we know that they are good for us), they are especially great for strengthening hair, thanks to all the nutrition they provide to the hair follicles. Also used to treat dandruff and itchy scalp, it&#8217;s great for those with hair problems.</p><p><strong>Digestive System: </strong>High in lignin, flax seeds are great to boost metabolism and thus, keep you away from diseases. Also a high source of fibre, they ensure smooth functioning of the digestive system. Say bye to your tummy problems!</p><p><strong>Skin:</strong><b> </b>Our favourite reason for eating flax seeds? It clears acne! The cray pollution in Delhi, dirt and sometimes for no reason, the acne pops up and flax seeds can help you with it. That’s not all, the fatty acid in these seeds will naturally moisturise your skin and minimise skin irritation, rashes or other skin inflammatory diseases.</p><p><strong>Nutrition:</strong><b> </b>Containing vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and antioxidants, they are ideal for those on a weight-loss or diabetic diet. Personally, we think they should be consumed by everyone, irrespective of whether you are on a diet or not.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hummus-1057998_1920.jpg"><img title = "#EatEffect // Everything You Need To Know About Flax Seeds!

So, you might want to put them in an airtight container and stock in the fridge. It&#8217;s essential that the flax oil is kept cold and not heated.</p><p>The seeds can be ground with an ordinary coffee grinder. Once done, these can be used for sprinkling in yoghurt, your daily morning routine of cereals, cookie batter or even a meatloaf. Flax seed muffins are our favourite! If you like the taste, feel free to gobble a teaspoon every morning with warm water before breakfast.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where</strong></h4><p>Our favourite place to get flax seeds is<a href="http://www.isayorganic.com/OW5MU1Zt/OW5MU1Zt/s-MTkzbkxTVm0/flax-seeds.html" target="_blank"> I Say Organic</a>.
