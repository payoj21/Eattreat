Seasonality and local sourcing of healthy ingredients is something that we value a lot at World in a Box. We have done a lot of experimenting on substitution cooking and local sourcing. We primarily need to understand the nutritional benefits plus</p><p>We primarily need to understand the nutritional benefits plus the flavour of the healthy ingredients. We recently replaced zucchini in our risottos with locally grown and easily available <em>tori </em>(Ridge Gourd<em>)</em>. To our surprise, it was very well accepted by the customers and in most of the cases, they didn&#8217;t even notice the substitution.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11873426_853679534700114_8660439324195954738_n.jpg"><img title = "#EatEffect // World In A Box&#039;s Alternative Healthy Ingredients Are Delicious AF  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4816" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11873426_853679534700114_8660439324195954738_n.jpg" alt = "Organic Kitchen ingredients healthy detox Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11873426_853679534700114_8660439324195954738_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11873426_853679534700114_8660439324195954738_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11873426_853679534700114_8660439324195954738_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Similarly, we go crazy for assorted berries because of their antioxidant properties. But do you know Indian grown <em>sahtoot</em> (mulberry) has similar health benefits but only got its due after getting mentioned in MasterChef Australia. Tch. We tried our smoothies with sahtoot instead of imported berries and many people loved this version more. Not to mention, it reduces the cost of the recipe by half.</p><p>Lots of these<a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//healthy-organic-superfoods-list-eateffect/"> superfoods</a> or the &#8220;marketed health food&#8221; has been in India forever but didn&#8217;t get penetration. Locally grown Amaranth is a great substitute for quinoa and has similar health benefits. We tried making burrito bowls with Amaranth and it tasted heavenly.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here&#8217;s What You Can Do</strong></h4><p>By going local not only are we promoting our farmers but also getting rid of chemicals used to increase shelf lives of healthy ingredients, reduce carbon footprints among other health benefits.</p><p>#EatExtra: Here are all the food substitutions you can make at home!
