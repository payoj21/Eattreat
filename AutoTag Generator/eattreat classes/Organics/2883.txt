No longer limited to tea, matcha green tea has been catching pace, fanning across countries in desserts, ice-creams and even savoury mains. Chefs are including this tea in their menus, curating special dishes to showcase its luscious green colour and unique astringent taste.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Matcha is finely grounded, powdered form of specially grown and processed green tea leaves. It involves processes unique to this tea for growing, harvesting and preserving. Consumed differently than other green tea leaves or bags, it is dissolved in water or milk for drinking purposes. Devoured without straining, it is more potent than other tea varieties.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>History&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Tea is an integral part of Chinese culture; originated in the country with Emperor Shen Nong, it was used as a vital medicinal herb. In the Tang Dynasty, people in western China stored tea by compressing it into hard bricks and cakes, allowing for longer preservation and easier transport. While making the beverage, they would simply break out a piece and toss it in boiling water, seasoning with ginger or salt. However, it was in the Song Dynasty, that the powdered tea was refined and popularised.</p><p>The preparation and consumption was then categorised into a celebration and ritual by Zen Buddhists, who departed the knowledge to Japanese monks visiting China. The tradition became an important part of Japanese culture, evolving into a Chanoyu ceremony, whereas it was under-appreciated and forgotten in China, until the recent global resurgence of matcha tea.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/japan-1604873_1920-1.jpg"><img title = "From Tea To Dessert &amp; More, We&#039;re Decoding Matcha For You Delhiwallahs  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2888" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/japan-1604873_1920-1.jpg" alt = "tea drinks Category:Drinks cafes beverages   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/japan-1604873_1920-1.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/japan-1604873_1920-1-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/japan-1604873_1920-1-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;">Grades Of Matcha</h4><p>While buying matcha, it is important you choose the right grade for yourself and understand its character, to not be ripped off!&nbsp; The quality is determined by multiple factors, the most important being location on the bush.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ceremony Grade</strong></p><p>Used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, it is made with the youngest tea leaves and is the finest quality available.
