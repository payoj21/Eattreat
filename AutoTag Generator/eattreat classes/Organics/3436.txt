You can also expect around 6-7 stores opening up in Delhi-NCR and Punjab in the next year or so. We are all particularly excited about their flameless kitchen that plates up healthy food, which doesn’t compromise on taste.</p><p>The chicken is marinated for a couple of hours and then roasted in a rotisserie. The entire menu is oil-less and then mostly baked or grilled. We are super excited to go check it out, so stay tuned!</p><p>Targeting us healthy foodies, that roast chicken comes at a perfect time, especially with a no-oil formula that we can get behind!</p><p>Explore the store <a href="https://www.facebook.com/krrindia/photos" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Read the full story <a href="http://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/food-entertainment/food-services/kenny-rogers-roasters-kkr-enters-india-with-its-flameless-kitchen-and-no-oil-chicken-recipe/54677190" target="_blank">here</a>. </strong></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:</em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/krrindia/photos/a.930069553735587.1073741829.930006887075187/1096616470414227/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank"><strong><em> Kenny Rogers Roasters India</em></strong></a></p>
