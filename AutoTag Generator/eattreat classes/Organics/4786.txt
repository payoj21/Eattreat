They’ve been doing things that really do go beyond our regular understanding of food presentation. They say that they don’t believe in full-blown main courses and so their entire menu is full of food that you’d normally get as a build up to the main course, while still providing generous portions.</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Moleculeggn/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Masala Library</strong></em></p>
