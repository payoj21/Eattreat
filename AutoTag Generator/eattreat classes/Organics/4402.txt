4402	6 Food Startups Waging The War On Kitchen Waste & Food Wastage	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a known fact that poverty, hunger and malnutrition are rampant in our country. While people can rain money on lavish weddings and enough kitchen waste is generated, desperation in the destitute for one meal in a day, is a very real truth. With a <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//carbon-footprint-food-waste-diwali-pollution/">Global Hunger Index</a> of 28.5, India ranks worse than Uganda, Rwanda and several others in hunger and malnutrition. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food wastage has turned into a pressing issue for our country but thanks to these initiatives, food wastage has now turned to a life-giving process; providing nourishment to the needy. Here&#8217;s a look at some of the innovative ideas that are changing the country for good.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Robin Hood Army</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All it took was a business trip to Portugal to build the idea for this innovative start-up. On a business trip to Portugal, Neel Ghose, Vice President, International Affairs, Zomato, came across an NGO, Re Food, that collected leftover food and fed it to the less privileged. He volunteered for the organisation which inspired him to start a similar charitable trust back home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Robin Hood Army (RHA), has achieved a very innovative way of reducing food wastage by collecting the surplus food and kitchen waste from the local restaurants to the underprivileged. The organisation does not accept monetary funds but recruits volunteers on a day to day basis. With its tie-ups with 17 restaurants, the Robin Hood Army works on their goodwill to promote its cause.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What once started as a small organisation in Delhi, soon spread to other parts of the country as well. Right from night shelters to the homeless orphanages, this organisation has been a guardian angel to all. Spread over 23 cities and a volunteer brigade of 5,000 noble people, this organisation has successfully fed over 5,00,000 people so far.</span></p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/robinhoodarmy/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Feeding India</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most people wouldn&#8217;t give a second thought on the food left over at weddings, here was a man who decided to put an end to the food wastage after attending a grand wedding catering to 10,000 guests and a menu consisting of over 35 different cuisines. Ankit Kawatra probably made the most important decision of his life that night when he saw the food hit the bin which could have fed at least 5,000 people, after deciding to stay back at the wedding. At 22, he set off to create a difference in this world when he quit his well-paying job at an MNC to pursue something that he truly believed in &#8211; put an end to the wastage of food and turn it into a life-saving avenue.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeding India, a non-profit enterprise, came up with an easy solution to use the enormous amount of food wasted on different occasions and feed it to the less fortunate. It collects the extra food from weddings, caterers and restaurants and provides it to the underprivileged class in the society.

The collection of excess food and kitchen waste is done by volunteers who store the food in cold storages in order to maintain the nutritious value and then it undergoes three rigorous levels of quality checking before distributing it to the needy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with a team of 5 members in Delhi, Feeding India has now more than 2200 volunteers from different fields like marketing, consultation, etc. To date, it has spread over 32 cities and has tie-ups with 75+ caterers and 20+ NGOs, providing over 13,00,000 meals and relentlessly encouraging people not to waste their food.</span></p><p>Explore more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/feedingindia1/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jevandabbe Vahatuk Mahamandal  (Mumbai Dabbawalas)</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dabbawalas started their service way back in 1890s during the time of the British Raj when junk food was not in vogue and office canteens had not been introduced.
