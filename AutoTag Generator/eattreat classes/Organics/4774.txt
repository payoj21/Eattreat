4774	#EatEffect // The Superfoods List You’ll Need For Your Dose Of Nutrients	<p>As part of the <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//eateffect-greenisthenewblack-eat-green/" target="_blank">#EatEffect</a>, we’re giving you the superfoods list that you need to include in your diet and where you can get them.</p><p>Of late, whenever we try looking for ways to get healthy with minimal effort, we’re met with information on ingredients described as ‘superfoods’. But, did you know that the term superfoods has no scientific or medical definition? It’s a marketing term that is used for foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and provide many health benefits.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Flax Seeds</strong></h4><p>Not only are <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//eateffect-everything-need-know-flax-seeds/" target="_blank">flax seeds</a> loaded with plant-based omega-3 like chia seeds, they also have more lignans—compounds that prevent certain types of cancer, than any food. You could have this sprinkled on your yoghurt or cold cereal. This superfoods list isn&#8217;t just about those avocados and good kinda fats.</p><p>Get it <a href="http://www.naturesbasket.co.in/Products/Roasted-Flax-Seeds---Healthy-Alternatives/1792_0_0_0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2.

Coconut Oil</strong></h4><p>This is a great alternative to vegetable oil, and here’s why. It helps reduce weight, converts bad cholesterols into good cholesterols, and promotes digestive and cardiovascular (heart) health. You could use coconut oil to cook your meals. What’s more is that it gives a great flavour too!</p><p>Get it <a href="http://www.amazon.in/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=virgin+coconut+oil+organic&amp;tag=googinhydr1-21&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=153859383322&amp;hvpos=1t3&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16870674905608927318&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9061646&amp;hvtargid=kwd-1798512278&amp;ref=pd_sl_2cz751d7nt_b" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Dried Prunes</strong></h4><p>They may look funny and shrivelled up, but they taste great and are packed with polyphenols—plant chemicals that are known to boost bone density by stimulating bone-building cells.

This one had to be on our superfoods list.</p><p>Get it <a href="http://www.bigbasket.com/ps/?q=prunes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. </strong><strong>Cocoa Powder</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cacao-Powder.jpg"><img title = "#EatEffect // The Superfoods List You&#039;ll Need For Your Dose Of Nutrients  #EatEffect // The Superfoods List You&#039;ll Need For Your Dose Of Nutrients  "class="alignnone wp-image-4780 size-full" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cacao-Powder.jpg" alt = "vegetarian Organic Kitchen ingredients healthy detox Category:Organics   vegetarian Organic Kitchen ingredients healthy detox Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cacao-Powder.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cacao-Powder-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cacao-Powder-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>VisualHunt</strong></em></p><p>Cacao powder contains flavonoids that help in lowering blood pressure and improve blood flow to the brain and heart.
