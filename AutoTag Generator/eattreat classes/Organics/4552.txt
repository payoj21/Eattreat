4552	#EatEffect // 5 Organic Healthy Ingredients To Pick From I Say Organic	<p><a href="http://www.isayorganic.com" target="_blank">I Say Organic</a> perfectly symbolises <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//eateffect-greenisthenewblack-eat-green/" target="_blank">healthy eating</a> and conscious living, not just personally but also in terms of environment. While we normally order our everyday vegetables from here, these 5 healthy ingredients are must have for winters!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>Certified as 100% organic, they take care of our surroundings as well as our body with pesticide, radiation and GMO-free ingredients. A highly monitored process ensures we get healthy ingredients from trusted farmers which are pure and fresh.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sweet Lime Pickle</strong></h4><p>Winters mean parathas and what better to accompany these than a pickle which is both sweet and sour (at least we are eating organic!). So next time you top your air fried parathas with a dollop of Nutrilite, pair it with this pickle for a perfect meal!</p><p>Order it from <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com/MTFFYnZoUw/i-MzI3RWJ2aFM/sweet-lemon-pickle.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Darjeeling Tea</strong></h4><p>Hot tea becomes a necessity as the temperature drops, but drinking masala chai every day or sometimes more (we can’t help ourselves) isn&#8217;t very healthy. Switch your masala chai with this organic darjeeling tea, right out of the plantations and you might just lose a few winter pounds this season!</p><p>Order it from <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com/MTB1bUdvbg/MHVtR29u/s-MzAydW1Hb24/darjeeling-tea-ctc.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Apricot Oil </strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13501809_1053143704740782_7895815902960095760_n.jpg"><img title = "#EatEffect // 5 Organic Healthy Ingredients To Pick From I Say Organic  "class="alignnone wp-image-4556 size-full" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13501809_1053143704740782_7895815902960095760_n.jpg" alt = "vegan Organic ingredients healthy food healthy grocery Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13501809_1053143704740782_7895815902960095760_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13501809_1053143704740782_7895815902960095760_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13501809_1053143704740782_7895815902960095760_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Skip creams and moisturisers this year and opt for this apricot oil to nourish your skin. Rich in vitamins, oleic acid and antioxidants, it has a calming and rejuvenating effect on skin and hair. Its anti-ageing and anti-carcinogenic properties are really motivating us to order it right away!</p><p>Order it from <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com/OExSQktx/MExSQktx/s-MjA4TFJCS3E/apricot-oil.html">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Whistling School Boy Coffee</strong></h4><p>All those out there who can’t open their eyes without having a cup of coffee, this one is for you. If you can’t kick your caffeine habit (we aren’t judging) then opt for an organic version which tastes like a traditional South Indian filter kaapi!</p><p>Order it from <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com/MTB2R1NyTw/MHZHU3JP/s-MzM4dkdTck8/the-whistling-school-boy-blazk-baza-coffee-co-kodagu-br-hills-.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jaggery/Gur</strong></h4><p>Another reason we love winters: Gur! An unprocessed, organic, amber coloured piece of jaggery is just heavenly. While we eat substantial amounts of jaggery after every meal, no one really seems to mind thanks to the health benefits. It strengthens the nervous system, reenergises the body and is full of antioxidants.</p><p>Order it from <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com/OXZJcUVQ/MHZJcUVQ/s-MjAwdklxRVA/jaggery-gur-yamuna-nagar-haryana-.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4><p>Explore more at I Say Organic <a href="http://www.isayorganic.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>I Say Organic</strong></em></p><hr /><p>This article is part of the EatTreat campaign to eat better and live more consciously.
