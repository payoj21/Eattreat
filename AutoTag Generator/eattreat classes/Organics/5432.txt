5432	Food Meditation & Mindful Eating Sessions Can Help You Combat Stress	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With stress levels on the rise, a new awakening is taking place among Delhiites who are now turning to alternative methods of combating stress. While meditation is a commonly prescribed antidote to stress, did you also know that food meditation is the next big thing?</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food Meditation Sessions were started in Delhi by Ananda Anaam, who has taken his meditation practice to another level by applying the rules of mindful meditation to eating food. His food meditation sessions, involve presenting ourselves to food, rather than the other way around. These sessions are non-commercial, and are aimed at bringing about harmony with Nature within and without. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What To Expect</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anaam serves a good meal during his sermon – chapatis made with pink amaranth, brown rice flavoured with 28 different herbs and spices sourced from the hills; and Pahari potatoes with mint and tomato chutney. But the spread is to be eaten in complete silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food meditation is suitable for all types of people, irrespective of their religious background or past meditation experience. In the session, you can expect to eat quietly, mindfully taking in each bite and developing a heightened sense of awareness besides attaining deep relaxation, insights into personality and a sense of deep gratitude. One can expect to realise the meaning of being present in the present.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s The Focus?</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main focus of the session is to make people aware of the changes that a simple act of eating and reflecting can bring about, and to introduce them to slow food movement, according to Ananda.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, sessions have been organised by Ananda Anaam in collaboration with Samsara. He organises these sessions on request across Delhi. So if you&#8217;re looking to stay fit in and out, we&#8217;d recommend this. </span></p><p>Explore Samsara <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/samsara25/about/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read the full story <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/delhi/report-food-for-thought-mindful-eating-sessions-bring-joy-to-delhiites-2282318" target="_blank">here</a>. </span></em></p>
