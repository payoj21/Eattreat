3422	There’s A ‘Skinny’ Prosecco That Has Half The Sugar & Is Completely Organic	<p>Sparkling wine is our soul food (drink rather) but when it comes to being healthy, it falls quite short. But don’t you worry, a new ‘skinny’ version of prosecco is coming and we can’t wait to try it. We hear that the drink will hit UK supermarkets at the beginning of next year.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></p><p>The diet wine only has 7g of sugar per litre, which translates to about 67 calories in a glassful (100ml). Made from grapes from the foothills of the Dolomites in Italy, this is a completely organic and vegan-friendly sparkly that we can’t wait to get our hands on.</p><p>The thing about this wine is that it isn’t as sweet as the others, because there’s no processed sugar added to it. Currently costing about £17.99 a bottle, Thomson and Scott introduced the Skinny Prosecco at Selfridges this year and it became so popular that they are now looking at stocking them across UK.</p><p>Perfect for those who want taste without compromising on health, this is available at Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and at other other high-end stores for now. They also have a Skinny Champagne, if that is up your alley!</p><p>You can also check out their website <a href="http://www.thomsonandscott.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, to order a bottle.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/thomsonandscott/photos/a.351495241654010.1073741830.349780495158818/801162913353905/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank"> Thomson &amp; Scott</a></em></p>
