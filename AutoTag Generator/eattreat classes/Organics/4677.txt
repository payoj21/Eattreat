Picnics and food stalls are just two examples where these come into use the most. Even economical airlines use plastic cutlery!

So, switch to these 100% biodegradable options whenever you find yourself in need of things to pack or dispose.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wood</strong></h4><p>Disposable packaging, tableware and cutlery; the wooden alternative is strong, microwave friendly and resistant to oils. We especially love the pine boat design and its #tablewaregoals.
