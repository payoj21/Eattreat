Something which will make this coming Diwali unique? There&#8217;s a solution to this problem and here are the five snacks you can try other than the clichéd faraal this Diwali!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Aloo Wadi</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aloo_Wadi.jpg"><img title = "5 Snacks From Down South Other Than The Cliched Faraal For Diwali  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3951" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aloo_Wadi.jpg" alt = "snacks mumbai iconic homemade authentic   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aloo_Wadi.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aloo_Wadi-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aloo_Wadi-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>An olive coloured snack made with <strong>arbi ke patte</strong> (colocasia leaves known as ‘<i>aloo’</i> in Marathi). These leaves are slathered with besan and spices; stacked on one another; steamed and the final cooked roll is cut into pieces.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Palak Sev</strong></h4><p>Ditch the old hum drum besan sev and try out<strong> palak (spinach) sev</strong> which along with being tasty adds brownie points to your health quotient! It is made by adding spinach puree to the sev dough (prepared with chickpea flour and spices) mixed in the sev dough and deep-fried till crisp.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anjeer Barfi</strong></h4><p>Ever thought what can be healthier than a sweet made with jaggery?

Who knew there would be another delicious use of this lentil other than in khichdi.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pudachi Wadi</strong></h4><p>The lesser known sister of <strong>aloo wadi</strong>, it  is a deep-fried flaky pastry (made with besan flour and spices) and  stuffed with sautéed chopped onions, poppy seeds and copra (dried coconut) filling. The x-factor in this savoury is the goda masala which is added to the filling which gives it a zing like no other!</p><p>These dishes will not only help you to find an easy alternative to your regular faraal, but also motivate you and your family members in celebrating a unique Diwali.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
