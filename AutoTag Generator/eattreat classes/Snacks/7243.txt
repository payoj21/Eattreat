7243	Roots – Cafe In The Park In Gurgaon Makes Your Meal Feel Like A Picnic	<p style="text-align: left;">One leisurely afternoon, we head out with Shagun of My Food Project to check out this lovely cafe in Gurgaon. Needless to say, the ambience and the very relaxed vibe of the place put us at ease as soon as we entered Roots Cafe Gurgaon.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Winter is one time when everyone is looking for places for a warm lunch, right? We are no different, but most of the places in Delhi demand a bomb to provide with such an ambience. Luck had it that a couple of teammates discovered this place called Roots-Café In The Park in Sector 29, Gurgaon and we visited the same day.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>You will find this café in the Rajiv Gandhi Renewable Energy Park, Leisure Valley. It is partly like a shack and partly open air under the shade of large trees. Very cute seating space and apt for winter afternoons and breakfast scenes.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Toast To</strong></h4><p>The shakes, chocolate shake and oreo shakes were decent for the price but could be thicker otherwise.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171.jpg"><img title = "Roots - Cafe In The Park In Gurgaon Makes Your Meal Feel Like A Picnic  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7280" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171.jpg" alt = "street food Category:Snacks cafes budget   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_6171-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>My Food Project</strong></em></p><p>The food is quite homely, totally vegetarian and value for money. They serve things such as <strong>Poha</strong>, <strong>Omelette sandwich</strong>, <strong>Pakode</strong>, <strong>Upma</strong>, <strong>Chai</strong>,<strong> filter coffee</strong>, <strong>shakes</strong>, <strong>palak patta chaat</strong> to name a few.</p><p>While the Upma, Pakode , Palak Patta Chaat and Rice Kheer were good to taste and had a good quantity, and the White Sauce Pasta was quite creamy and nice!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The drinks could be a bit thicker, but the price makes up for it. Additionally, the Wai Wai Chat, Poha , Mushroom Cutlet and Brownie were average. Poha was bland, Wai Wai Chaat was too spicy, Mushroom Cutlet lacked a strong taste of mushroom and Brownie wasn’t gooey. Even the Mix Sauce Pasta was average and tangier than necessary.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Overall, the experience deserves and above average rating from us.  We will surely be back for the lovely outdoor seating and some dishes while some could be improved upon.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Rajiv Gandhi Renewable Energy Park, Leisure Valley, Sector 29, Gurgaon</p><p><strong>Say hello at </strong><span class="fontsize2 bold zgreen"><span class="tel" tabindex="0">+91 9971134920, </span></span><span class="fontsize2 bold zgreen"><span class="tel" tabindex="0">0124 2574616</span></span></p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 750 for two</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RootsCafeGurgaon/" target="_blank">Roots Cafe In The Park</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Roots- Cafe In The Park</strong></em></p>
