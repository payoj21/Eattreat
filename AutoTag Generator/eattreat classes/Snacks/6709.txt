We’ve picked out a couple of these budget restaurants in CP for you to check out when you’re here.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mutton Cutlets At Indian Coffee House</strong></h4><p>The rooftop of Mohan Singh Place near the Hanuman Mandir is occupied by one of the oldest coffee houses in this part of the town.

It’s a tiny place which is always crowded with people, no matter which day of the week, or what time of the day. We often go here for the waffles which are some of the softest ones one can ever get in the city. You could get the classic one with butter and honey/maple syrup, or top it up with some Nutella.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> A-18, Radial Road, Connaught Place, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23328589</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 400 for two people (approx.).</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Wengers-Deli-241702302544114/" target="_blank">Wenger’s Deli</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fish ’n’ Chips At Cha Bar</strong></h4><p>Step into Oxford Bookstore at the corner of N Block and you’re greeted by busy faces hurrying about completing food orders.

Their <strong>dosa</strong>, <strong>idlis</strong> and <strong>filter coffee</strong> are what we order for a normal Sunday brunch. However, it’s their <strong>milk Mysore Pak</strong> we love even more!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 50, Janpath, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23317755 &amp; 011 23316060</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 500 for two people (approx.).</p><p>Explore <a href="http://www.saravanabhavan.com/restaurants.php?cn=India&amp;cy=Delhi" target="_blank">Saravana Bhavan</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Biryani At Anand Restaurant</strong></h4><p>This place is located in the by lanes of Janpath, so it may be a little tricky to locate. It may not be the most aesthetic place, but you wouldn’t care so much about that once you get your plate of steaming hot Biryani. For the price they charge, the quantity is enough for two people—unless you have a large appetite.</p><p><a href="http://www.saravanabhavan.com/restaurants.php?cn=India&amp;cy=Delhi">Head to</a> 15/96, Scindia House, Connaught Place, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23313349 &amp; 011 23313554</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 500 for two people (approx.).</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Anand-Restaurent-CP-157150071034725/" target="_blank">Anand Restaurant</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Biryani At Tee Pee &#8211; O Restaurant</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani.jpg"><img title = "#EatCheap: Budget Restaurants In Connaught Place For Meals For 2 Under INR 500  #EatCheap: Budget Restaurants In Connaught Place For Meals For 2 Under INR 500  #EatCheap: Budget Restaurants In Connaught Place For Meals For 2 Under INR 500  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7193" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani.jpg" alt = "lunch Indian ice cream connaught place coffee Category:Snacks budget   lunch Indian ice cream connaught place coffee Category:Snacks budget   lunch Indian ice cream connaught place coffee Category:Snacks budget   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hyderabadi_Chicken_Biryani-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p><p>Another place for biryanis, Tee Pee &#8211; O is where you can go to if you want fast service and decent food and if you don’t mind a cramped seating arrangement which is always crowded with people. You literally just get to sit, order, eat, pay, and leave since there’ll always be a couple of people waiting. This is great if you just have INR 500 and you’re only getting either <strong>Chicken</strong> or <strong>Mutton Biryani</strong>.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 118-119, Mohan Singh Place, Connaught Place</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 23361550 &amp; +91 9891071200</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 500 for two people (approx.).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Burgers At Burger Singh</strong></h4><p>They’re a comparatively new QSR which serves some really nice burgers. The <strong>Bihari Gosht Burger</strong> is our favourite, but it’s slightly over the budget for this list. However, you should try the <strong>United States of Punjab Burger</strong>(both veg and non-veg) and the <strong>Potato Crunch Burger</strong>.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> H-45, Connaught Place</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> +91 8767121212</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 500 for two people (approx.).</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BurgerSinghIndia/" target="_blank">Burger Singh</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ice Cream At Naturals</strong></h4><p>This ice cream parlour from Mumbai has become a favourite destination for those who just have a craving for freshly made ice cream with natural flavours. It may be a tad expensive in comparison to the popsicles that are available at the many ice cream carts in and around CP, but it’s worth it! We recommend the <strong>Tender Coconut</strong>, <strong>Chikoo</strong>, and <strong>Jackfruit flavours</strong>.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> L8, L Block Outer Circle, Connaught Place</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 6537 0007</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 150 for two people approx.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Natural-Ice-Cream-1529799517349129/" target="_blank">Naturals Ice Cream</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>The Lalit Food Truck Company</strong></em></p>
