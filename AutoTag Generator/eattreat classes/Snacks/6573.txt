6573	Now, Vendors Serving Street Food In Delhi Will Be Seen Wearing A Uniform	<p>We’re used to seeing the vendors at our favourite chaat corners wearing casual clothes and have probably never given a thought to what they wear while gorging on those <em>golgappas</em> that we love so much. But very soon, we’re going to see these vendors serving street food in Delhi donning a cap, gloves, a t-shirt, and an apron when we go to them for our weekly (let’s be honest—daily) fix of <em>papri chaat</em> and <em>dahi bhalle</em>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>About 23,000 street vendors in Delhi are going to be trained in health and hygiene standards to keep at par with international standards. The move is in line with Project Clean Drive—an initiative by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.</p><p>The vendors will be given a kit that’ll come with two aprons, a t-shirt, a cap, a hand sanitizer, and 50 disposable plastic gloves. The training of vendors will happen in phases—the first one being in Lajpat Nagar, Sarojini, Nagar, Malviya Nagar, and Sarai Kale Khan.</p><p>They will not only be given these kits to guarantee the dispensing of food hygienically, but they’ll also be given a health chart with indicators to make sure that they’re following all the steps while dispensing food to their customers. Finally,  you won&#8217;t have to listen to your mum telling you horror stories about street food in Delhi, every time you go out to get yourself a plate of chaat (the struggle is real).</p><p>Apparently, there have been hiccups in the process of certifying the vendors, since many of them either don’t have an Aadhar card, or haven’t linked them with their bank accounts. And so, about 6,000 of these vendors will get certified in the first phase. The only way to speed up the certification of the rest of the vendors is by having them fill all their details correctly during the process.</p><p>Read the full story <a href="https://www.hungryforever.com/delhi-street-food-vendors-may-soon-seen-wearing-gloves-caps-aprons/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>NASVI</strong></em></p>
