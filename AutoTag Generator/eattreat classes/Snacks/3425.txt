Tamatar Ki Chaat, Varanasi</strong></h4><p>A speciality from Varanasi, this chaat is made with plump tomatoes appearing like bhaji. It is a perfect combination of sweet, sour and spicy.

Matra Chaat, Delhi</strong></h4><p><strong>Matra kulcha</strong> is common street food in Delhi, but matra chaat is even better when you are craving something less filling and just as delicious.

Now served across the country, it tops the list of comforting chaats. Try it at any of the chaat places, though our favourite remains Bengali Sweet House for relishing this hollow kachori.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>11. Aloo Anday Ki Bhujia, Darjeeling&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>A lesser known chaat, it is famous in Darjeeling. Available at every street corner, it’s a concoction of potatoes, eggs, onions and bhujia brought together with a strong chilli flavour. It’s not for the faint hearted, but if you do try it you will not be disappointed.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>12. Aloo Dom, Darjeeling</strong></h4><p>Fried potatoes served with a spicy tangy chutney, it has more chilli than the one chutney served with momos! A Darjeeling special, it is utterly ravishing. Try it at a street corner and not some fancy shop for a memorable experience.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>13.&nbsp;Misal Pav, Maharashtra</strong></h4><p>A popular dish available almost everywhere in Maharashtra, <strong>Misal Pav</strong> is essentially a bread roll (pav), with a spicy curry made with sprouted moth beans (misal).

The pav is usually toasted with butter, and the dish is served with papad and buttermilk.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>14. Aloo&nbsp;Kabli, West Bengal&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>A mix of roughly cut boiled potatoes, tamarind chutney and lots and lots of kabuli chana, <strong>Aloo Kabli</strong> is a patent evening snack in Bengali households. This Bong potato salad is all kinds of tangy and yummy&nbsp;and comes with a healthy dose of onions, green chillies, tomatoes and coriander. The best thing is that you can eat almost an entire bowl of this and be done for the day. Not to say, this boiled/raw salad is as healthy as street food can ever get.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>15. Ragda Pattice, Mumbai&nbsp;</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties.jpg"><img title = "#TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  "class="alignnone wp-image-7527 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties.jpg" alt = "sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ragada_Patties-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Mumbai originated chaat is similar to spicy <strong>Aloo Chaat</strong> which is topped over a dal made from chickpeas, also known as “Ragda”. The chutney and Sev just add to its value &amp; &nbsp;make this one of the popular chats. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>16.

This layered chat originated in Mumbai is simply divine.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>18. Hari Chutney Ke Aloo, Kanpur</strong></h4><p><strong>Dhaniya ke Aloo</strong> is a popular snack in Kanpur, especially during winters as dhaniya/ coriander is available in plenty at this time of in India. Known as <strong>Chutney Wale Aloo</strong> in other northern states of India. These small boiled potatoes are soaked in spicy coriander chutney—that&#8217;s all it is! It sounds simple, yet it is very flavourful. You can try this with some chapatis. In fact, you can make a wrap stuffed with chutney walley aloo.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>19. Papri Chaat, Meerut</strong></h4><p>From the delicious jalebis to the mouth-watering golgoppas, Meerut is known for its street food. The city people are obsessed with the cream at Hariya Ki Lassi and the spice in the <strong>papri chaat</strong> at Abu Lane. Meerut has a wide range of food which is enough to meet every choice and taste of every taste bud. One can find a huge crowd in the evening while at Abu Lane. The variety is not curtailed, it has extended to South Indian as well as Chinese food too.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>20. Daulat Ki Chaat/Malaiyo, Delhi</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi.jpg"><img title = "#TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  "class="alignnone wp-image-7530 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi.jpg" alt = "sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Daulat_Chaat_in_Old_Delhi-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Our mental picture of chaat is something with salt, sweet &amp; sour tastes &amp; a variety of ingredients with different tastes &amp; textures served together. This chaat does not have anything to do with salt or sour or chatpata chaat masala. It is a sweet fluffy dessert made from milk.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/famous-food-joints-near-chandni-chowk-old-delhi-food-walk/">The frothy, sweet, creamy dessert</a> is essentially the Indian version of the <strong>deconstructed cheesecake</strong>. We&#8217;re told that the milk is boiled and cooled, and later churned for about 8 hours continuously to give it that light, almost buttery texture. It is enriched with khoya and saffron, and many top it with a little bit of crushed pistachio and almonds too.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>21. Dabeli, Ahmedabad</strong></h4><p>Originating in the Kutch region of Gujarat, <strong>Dabeli</strong>&nbsp;is a spicy snack made by mixing boiled potatoes with a dabeli masala, and putting the mixture between pav and served with chutneys made from tamarind, date, garlic, red chilies, etc. and garnished with pomegranate and roasted peanuts.</p><p>It looks like an Indian version of the burger with fried-potato sprinkles on top. But one bite is enough to tell you the difference that inside lies a unique combination of a variety of flavors and textures. The taste explodes in your mouth and brings you to salivation so you just want to take bite after bite after bite.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>22. Chana Ghuni, Bihar</strong></h4><p><strong>Chana</strong> is cooked in different parts of India in different ways. <strong>Chana Ghuni</strong> is a simple and traditional curry of Bihar which is made with black chickpeas.&nbsp; It is a dry recipe which can ideally go with any type of main dish like roti, chapati, rice, moori etc. Little bit of spice and can be paired great with the &#8216;Dhuska&#8217;. It is very popular in almost all Bihari homes. This is a great evening snack as well with some chopped onions and coriander leaves garnished on top.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>23.&nbsp;Phuchka, West Bengal</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall.jpg"><img title = "#TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  "class="alignnone wp-image-7535 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall.jpg" alt = "sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phuchka-stall-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Never to be left behind in this milieu of street food and snacks, <strong>Phuchka</strong> is Bengal’s answer to your golgappe and panipuri. What makes it different is the spicy potato filling and the tamarind water (not to be confused with jaljeera). The whole ensemble is one of a kind and teary eyes after a dose of the spicy snack is not uncommon. And don&#8217;t forget to ask for your<strong> churmur</strong> once you&#8217;re done!&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>24. Masala Muri, West Bengal</strong></h4><p>Quite common in the lanes of West Bengal, we have also found Delhi thela-wallahs to have a similar concoction. Mixing puffed rice with lemon, some bhujia, chillies and onions, this makes for a quick healthy snack when hunger strikes. And the best part? You can ask your local hawker to make it exactly like you want.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>25. Mutton Ghooghni, West Bengal</strong></h4><p>Another Bengali preparation that makes something legendary out of the ordinary. The ordinary ghooghni is a wonderful appetiser, but add chunks of meat to it and you have yourself a delicacy that brings customers from far and wide. The classic <strong>mutton ghooghni</strong> has the smoky flavour of meat and a host of chana dal gravy with a sprinkle of onion kachumbar on top.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>26. Alur Dom, West Bengal</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom.jpg"><img title = "#TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  #TheBigList: 35 Classic Chaats That Have Defined Indian Street Food  "class="alignnone wp-image-7536 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom.jpg" alt = "sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   sweet street food snacks savoury regional fast food Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom-825x493.jpg 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom-410x246.jpg 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alur-dom-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Most phuchka-wallahs in Bengal keep a basketful of boiled potatoes ready to be served as <strong>alur dom</strong>. Not your standard cooked fare, this dom is tossed in a bunch of masalas. The result is an angry red fare that tastes just as devilishly good. Make sure you get those toothpicks to pick out your pieces, or else that chilli can wreak havoc.</p><div><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>27. Shakarkandi Chaat, Uttar Pradesh</strong></h4><p>Something which you don&#8217;t hear everyday in other parts of the country, this sweet potato chaat is famous in Delhi and believe you us, the sweetness is only an aftertaste. It&#8217;s full of lemon, spices and you can even top it with crunchy papadis for a delicious meal. Some of us might consider sweet potato to be boring and only eaten during fasts, that too peeled or boiled, and this is something completely different and fun.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>28. Aloo Tikki, Delhi</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">Since it is one of the most common Indian chaats you can see a thela-ful of it everywhere in and around Delhi &amp; Northern India. It is simple to make and yet one of the most delicious snack ever.
