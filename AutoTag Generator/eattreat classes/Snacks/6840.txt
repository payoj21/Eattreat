6840	#EatCheap: 6 Budget Restaurants In GK II When You’re Feeling The Cash Burn	<p>One of our favourite places for catching up with friends has to be the GK II Market, since, in recent years, it’s become a little quieter than usual.

We’ve picked out our top 6 selections of budget restaurants in GK II for when you can’t afford that cuppa at Starbucks, but are still looking to catch a quick bite.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anupam Sweets</strong></h4><p>Anupam Sweets is probably one of the few places that still exists here, even after all the others shut shop.
