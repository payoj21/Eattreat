6837	Pizza, Pasta & Chowmein Samosas: Kumar Samose Wala Reinvents The Humble Samosa	<p><strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong> went on one of their food expeditions around town and this time it was Kumar Samose Wala doing fusion street food with 32 kinds of samosas. So what do think happened? We gorged, of course!</p><hr /><p>I wouldn’t be wrong in saying that every Delhite has had atleast one samosa in their lifetime. Most of us have had the same spicy mashed potato filling wrapped in deep fried crusty yet soft shell, right?</p><p>Well, I present to you an individual who has changed the way samosas taste. The range of samosas he offers has customers lining up outside his shop every single day. The concept is so simple, yet intriguing. You can’t help but have a bite.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s So New?</strong></h4><p>You must have had pizza, pasta and chowmein as stand-alone dishes but have you ever had them inside a samosa? The answer is no, isn’t it? These are the variants of samosas they serve apart from using <strong>Malai Chaap</strong>, <strong>Malai Paneer</strong>, <strong>Paneer Korma</strong> and even<strong> Chocolate</strong> as fillings! (Yes! You read that right.) Now that your mouth is sufficiently salivated, I shall proceed to tell you how they taste so you can slurp as you read on.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20160904_232400.jpg"><img title = "Pizza, Pasta &amp; Chowmein Samosas: Kumar Samose Wala Reinvents The Humble Samosa  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6857" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20160904_232400.jpg" alt = "street food snacks north Indian fast food Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20160904_232400.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20160904_232400-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20160904_232400-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20160904_232400-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>The first one I tried was the <strong>Malai Chaap samosa</strong>. Its outward appearance was similar to the usual samosa. Upon crushing it from the middle, small bits of chaap covered in a paste of malai were visible. Even though, the thought of such a dish was fascinating, I still had my doubts about the taste. But it was definitely the best samosa and the best Malai Chaap I have ever had! The salty Chaap covered in slightly marinated Malai cream was a warm welcome to the taste buds and the crispy Samosa shell which held this amazing filling went along really well in terms of taste. I also tried the <strong>Chowmein Samosa</strong> which is basically noodles fried in hot spices and veggies and then wrapped in a samosa. The overall experience was like having bite-sized chowmein parcels which was awesome!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Owner Speak</strong></h4><p>I asked the owner, Mr. Deep Bhutani ji how he came up with the idea of making this fusion street food to which he explained that people had started to gravitate towards other snacks– foreign and native alike as samosas have had the same taste since their inception. So, he decided to change the way samosas tasted and decided to bring variety to this historic dish.</p><p>The price ranges from INR 15 to 20 which is super affordable considering the novelty of idea and quality of the samosas. That’s the reason why the shop is perpetually thronged by customers between 5.30 PM to 9.00 PM. The name of the shop is ‘Kumar Samose’ and it is near the Moti Nagar Metro Station. Anybody would be happy to guide you to this fusion street food.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> 2/31, Near Milan Cinema, Karampura, Moti Nagar Metro Station</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at +91 9811340381</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 40 for two</p><p>Explore<a href="https://www.facebook.com/KumarSamoseWala/" target="_blank"> Kumar Samose Wala</a></p><p><em>This article was first published on the<a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/kumar-samose-wala/" target="_blank"> Delhi Food Walks blog</a> by Kshitij Rathore.</em></p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
