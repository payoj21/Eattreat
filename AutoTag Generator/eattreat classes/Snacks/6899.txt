6899	#EatCheap: 9 Budget Bars In CP For The End-Of-The-Month Drinking Party	<p>Demonetization or not, bars in CP have always been the place to be. In any case, who even pays for alcohol with cash, amirite? Even so, it’s always nice to have a few options where you can go to at the end of the month to have a good time. Here are a few budget bars in CP where you can go to have fun, without spending too much.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>My Bar Square</strong></h4><p>Probably THE go-to place at any point of time in the month. The place is always buzzing with people, and more often than not has a waiting list even on weekday afternoons. This is the favourite spot for all the millennials in the city, no matter which My Bar they go to. You could go here, or the slightly more luxurious My Bar Headquarters. The prices are just too good to be true.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> E-34&amp;35, Connaught Place.</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 097110 18188</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 85 for a pint of beer, INR 250 for a cocktail.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MyBarSquare/?ref=br_rs&amp;qsefr=1" target="_blank">My Bar Square</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Café MRP</strong></h4><p>This is one of the few budget bars in CP that sells alcohol at the maximum retail price and is easily one of the few bars that people visit over and over again.
