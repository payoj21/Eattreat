8079	LSR’s Famous Bombay Ishtyle Chaat Is Where Students Head To For A Mid-Day Snack	<p><strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong> tells us something this time that we already have a bit of idea about: Chaat. And specifically the LSR chaat that is available right outside its hallowed gates. The magic of LSR may in fact be in this chaat-wala&#8217;s art.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>So, now if I go around asking most of my fellow DU-ites about where do they head for a daily ‘let’s-have-a-snack’ break? It is most obvious that that I’d be greeted with peevish faces (primarily because of their arduous routine!). But, when it comes to the all girls’ college with the most upbeat crowd across DU, all the cheerless faces disappear. And here’s where the most loved bombay bhel puri right outside Lady Shri Ram College For Women comes into the picture.</p><p>On being told that something would be published about his daily job,, the proud owner Shri Yaad Ram instantly said he’s been running this food joint (portable that too!) from 11.00 am &#8211; 5.00 pm every day for the past 25 years and is still going strong. That’s not just it; this irresistible range of chaats can also be savoured at Central Market, Lajpat Nagar after 6.00 pm every day.</p><h4><strong>What&#8217;s Different?</strong></h4><p>Unlike other chaat walas, Yaad Ram Ji has kept his menu short and sweet (rather tangy) limiting it to only three dishes that he offers. Undoubtedly, all three are ‘must haves’. Starting with the first one, his speciality among the three and most popular among the Elsa crowd is the <strong>bombay bhel puri.</strong> It is an extreme blend of chutneys along with generous use of onion and coriander which make it look and taste like a Bhel puri in actuality.</p><p>Next is the Elsa crowd’s second most favourite snack post class; the <strong>sev puri.</strong> This too is a sweet-savoury combo with lots of onion &amp; sev (which is the prime characteristic of sev puri). And the last but not the least, is the<strong> jhal moori</strong>. Less popular among the Elsa chaat aficionados but nevertheless, it’s definitely worth a try. It’s a dry combo of puffed rice, peanuts, etc. as against the other two items. Here, Yaad ram ji adds that the “2 teaspoons of touch of oil enhances its flavour, but, the health conscious LSR girls avoid it.”</p><p>Very reasonably priced at INR 30 &#8211; 50 per item, it will make you forget the lavish gourmet, you spend your bucks on or the fame LSR Cafe. So, take out time from your slog schedule and head for a “let’s-have-a-snack” break to jerk your taste buds.</p><p>Cheers! Happy eating!</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> LSR Campus, Lala Lajpat Rai Marg, Lajpat Nagar</p><p><em>This article first appeared on the <a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/bombay-ishtyle-chaat/" target="_blank"><strong>Delhi Food Walks Blog </strong>by<strong> Navani Satija</strong></a>.</em></p><p><em>Representative Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
