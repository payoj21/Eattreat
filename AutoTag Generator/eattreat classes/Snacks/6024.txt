6024	What! Noida Metro Brings A Metro Coach Cafe To Teach Passenger Etiquette?	<p>During rush hours, the Metro is hardly the standard for civilised behaviour. Not once has a person been in the Metro without complaining about, and later being a part of, the pushing and shoving that ensues when the train doors open. The people in Delhi NCR may be known for many things, but patience is surely not one of them. The Metro Coach Cafe, thus, comes at a crucial time.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>In an effort to educate the citizens, a Metro coach-like cafe is in the works on the Noida-Greater Noida Aqua line (yes, that’s the colour they’re giving it). They think that with a tummy full and a not-so-hurried meal in a great ambience, you’d be more receptive to the many announcements that they have running about keeping your hands off the doors, not sitting on the floor of the compartment, standing behind the yellow line, and giving your seat to those in greater need.</p><p>The cafe is going to be set up by the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC). While it does not promise a fine dining experience, it will serve snacks and beverages. Their aim is to teach metro etiquette through announcements, and the many posters hung on/ stuck to the walls.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHY?!</strong></h4><p>One may wonder why anyone would want to go here to learn and implement metro etiquette when people get to hear these announcements every day and turn a deaf ear to it, or only treat it as background music (at best). The metro coach cafe authorities hope to draw crowds through the element of curiosity. They feel that the people will want to visit the restaurant just to see what a metro cafe might look like.</p><p>At the moment, it is not clear whether there will be a charge for entering the restaurant, but they say that they might introduce a token system and AFC gates &#8211; just like the ones we have at metro stations. The cafe is still in planning stage and will start operations when the Aqua line starts functioning in May or June 2017.</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/coach-like-cafe-to-coach-commuters-in-metro-manners/articleshow/56204140.cms" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
