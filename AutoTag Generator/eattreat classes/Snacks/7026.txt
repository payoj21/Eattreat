7026	Craving Dhabe Ka Khana? A Late Night Trip To Sukhdev Dhaba Sounds About Right	<p>A road trip without dhabhe ka food is incomplete, that too if you are traveling towards Punjab. Located on Delhi-Punjab National Highway1, Amrik Sukhdev Dhabha has been serving lip smacking food to all &#8211; from truck drivers to families, from students craving for midnight chai to couples wanting to taste legacy. And<strong> Delhi Food Walks</strong> is telling us all about the food at Sukhdev!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why Food At Sukhdev Dhaba?</strong></h4><p>Situated amidst luscious greens this dhabha is open 24×7 and sometimes so crowded that you will have to wait atleast 15-20 mins to find a place to sit. “Weekend mornings are always crowded” adds Rajiv, a frequent customer to this place, “especially if the weather is nice too.”</p><p>All kinds of pure vegetarian food at Amrik Sukhdev Dhaba is available and have added continental, Chinese and other famous delicacies to their menu over the passage of time. Considering Amrik Sukhdev Dhaba from the dhabha point of view, its phenomenal, with a huge parking lot, team of 50-60 working 24×7, clean washrooms and even a small shopping complex selling things like garments and groceries but considering Sukhdev from the dhabha food point of view, of being spicy, full of flavours and giving you the typical Indian food, a lot of people complain of it losing its essence and food quality over the years.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What We Ordered</strong></h4><p>I ordered the famous <strong>aloo ka parantha</strong> which they served with lots of white butter and curd. The parantha though was a little bland but appropriately stuffed and with curd, its savior. The next on my list was the <strong>buttermilk</strong> which was indeed worth the price and so was the<strong> chai</strong>, though not as kadak as the weather. Sukhdev’s speciality, their <strong>makke di roti</strong> and <strong>sarson da saag</strong>, is another good food on the list if you haven’t tasted it in a while. Other food items such as <strong>chowmein</strong>,<strong> idli</strong> and <strong>dosas</strong> are ordinary, hanging somewhere in between their amazing dishes and the ordinary ones.</p><p>Once upon a time Sukhdev which was famous for its extremely delicious food is now just a place known for its specialties. This place is totally worth a visit if you need a break from your neck-breaking driving journey and in urgent to need of good, hygienic food.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> No. 52, 250KM Stone, G.T Road, Murthal, Sonipat, Haryana</p><p><strong>Say hello</strong> at +91 86076 10002</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 500 for two</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amriksukhdev/" target="_blank">Amrik Sukhdev Dhaba</a></p><p><em>Written By: <strong>Sanskriti Nagar</strong></em></p><p><em>This piece was first published on<a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/sukhdev-dhaba/" target="_blank"> Delhi Food Walks</a>.</em></p>
