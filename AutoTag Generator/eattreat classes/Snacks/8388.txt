Like all others, I also &nbsp;found it very hard to believe the claim and decided to check it for myself.</p><div><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><p>I tried to explore every nook and corner of the famous streets of Purani Dilli, starting from Bara Dari, Ballimaran, Matia Mahal, Lal kuan, Sardar Swarup Chowk, Khari baoli to Chandni Chowk including many&nbsp;kuchas&nbsp;and&nbsp;galis&nbsp;to find out a place where one can have a wholesome meal at Rs 5.</p><h4><strong>What We Found</strong></h4><p>Nothing seemed to put an end to my search. However, on my way to Fathepuri Masjid, I located a small shop at Sardar Swarup Chowk, ‘Lala ji Poori Sabzi Wale’.The shop was crowded, a large number of people were queuing up with money in their hands to grab a plate of Lala ji’s&nbsp;poori&nbsp;and&nbsp;sabzi.</p><p>Here you can get three&nbsp;poori(s)&nbsp;with&nbsp;aloo&nbsp;and&nbsp;chana sabzi&nbsp;for INR 10!
