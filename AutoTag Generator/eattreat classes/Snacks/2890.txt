Here Are 5 Tips To Make A Winning Poached Egg	<p>A &nbsp;toast with poached egg and hollandaise sauce, garnished with chives is what breakfast dreams are made of. Making a poached egg? Not so much! So, we bring to you some easy tricks on how to make poached eggs.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Use Fresh Eggs At Room Temperature</strong></h4><p>An eggâ€™s age is extremely important while poaching. In an old egg, the whites start to loosen up and become more fluid, making it hard to coagulate, resulting in a withered poached egg. A fresh egg has tightened whites, reducing the chances of wispy bits. Using cold eggs lowers the water temperature disturbing the poaching process.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Crack The Egg In A Ramekin Before Poaching</strong></h4><p>If you dread cracking the egg directly into water, use this trick to make your life easier. Crack the egg in a ramekin prior to boiling the water. Once heated, slowly pour the egg whites first followed by yolk. Easy peasy!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Poach In A Few Inches Of Water</strong></h4><p>Watching the water bowl like a hawk while waiting for it to boil? Not anymore! Use a broad pan with a few inches of water allowing it to boil rather quickly. This also keeps the egg from bobbling around and the whites to remain close together.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Add Salt And Vinegar To The Boiling Water</strong></h4><p>A splash of vinegar drops the water temperature lower, allowing the egg whites to set faster and coagulate together, giving you a flawless poached egg. Salt also helps in decreasing the feathering as salinity is proportional to the coagulation temperature.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Create A Whirlpool</strong></h4><p>Using a wooden spoon, swirl the water before adding the egg. Vortex causes the egg to move in a circular motion, preventing it from splitting apart and allowing the egg whites to completely cover the yolk inside.</p><p><b>#EatExtra&nbsp;</b>Take the humble egg to a new level by poaching it in red wine (port) and it will be unlike anything you have had before.</p>
