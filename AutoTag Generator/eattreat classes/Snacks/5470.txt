5470	Ever Wondered What Explorers Eat On Their South Pole Expeditions?	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man has an unending thirst for adventure, and it is because of his growing appetite for exploring that he has forayed into uncharted territories like the Antarctic. Not for the faint hearted, a South Pole expedition involves hardships unforeseen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the dark, frosty monotony of the Antarctic winter, food provides an exciting source of variety and is like a beacon of hope, something for the explorers to look forward to. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>So What Do They Eat On South Pole Expeditions?</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Nimrod Expedition (1907-1909), among the edible items intended to sustain 15 men for two years were – 1600 pounds of “finest York hams”, 1260 pounds of sardines, 1470 pounds of tinned bacon, and 25 cases of whiskey. There was also plenty of ox tongue, sheep tongue and pork tongue, presumably for variety. The booze list comprised of 25 cases of whiskey, 6 cases of brandy, 6 cases of champagne and 3 cases of port. Apart from these, tinned biscuits found favour with the explorers on this South Pole expedition.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At McMurdo, the US Station where the majority of Antarctic explorers and researchers stay, delivery of dried and frozen food takes place just once a year. During summer, planes deliver fresh produce once a week. In winter, though, researchers have to live off non-perishables. Fortunately, there is the occasional opportunity to eat fresh veggies thanks to hydroponics: Greenhouse gardens that provide lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes and herbs.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s Different?</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty nations have their stations on the continent, and a few cultural differences are evident in their approach to food and drink. Food on base &#8211; where chefs prepare three meals a day, plus a midnight ration, is different from food </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the field. Researchers on-field are issued high-calorie rations designed to sustain them during hard work in polar conditions. There is also pemmican, a squishy, compressed mush of protein and fat that can be eaten quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re sure your curiosity has been piqued when it comes to South Pole Expedition food.
