8427	Budget Chinese Fare At Noodle Court Makes Us Want To Go All The Way To Naraina	<div id="m_2910111454706053621yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487652414776_6602"><p><span id="m_2910111454706053621yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1487652414776_6608"></span>Living in Naraina or West Delhi? On a budget and want to try some fresh and spicy Chinese? Head to this small joint located in Naraina Vihar or order home delivery for budget Chinese in West Delhi.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Situated in the G Block of Naraina Vihar, Noodle Court is a pocket-friendly Chinese joint that serves perfect spicy Chinese snacks and main course. This small hole-in-the-wall near the PNB bank doesn&#8217;t&nbsp; have &nbsp;any seating&nbsp; but quick take away and home delivery options are available.</p><h4><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>They only have a few tables where you can stand and have tasty noodles or chilli chicken but if you aren&#8217;t up for that they also have quick takeaway option or you can also just call in to order some fast Chinese fare. Perfect time to order delicious street Chinjabi from here would be afternoon since that is when they&#8217;ve already set up and are ready to serve. Although, it&#8217;s open from 11 am to 11 pm.</p><h4><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>Noodle Court does not have any other refreshment other than chilled soft drinks. And we think, pocket friendly Chinese food tastes even better when had with a chilled aerated coke or thumbs up.</p><h4><strong>&nbsp;On A Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>&nbsp;They prepare your food only after the order is received, therefore the food and flavours are always fresh when they reach your doorstep. One can never complain about their portion sizes as half a plate of noodles (any) and half a plate of <strong>Chilli Paneer</strong> or <strong>Chicken</strong> would be sufficent for one to have anytime during the day. And this whole medley would cost you about INR 150 tops.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ask any local Naraina resident, the direction to the best momo in Naraina Vihar, they will point you towards Noodle Court and just so you know, their momos are generally sold out by&nbsp;8 pm in the evening. We recommend the <strong>Fried&nbsp;Chicken Momo</strong> and <strong>Chilli Garlic Noodles,</strong> which&nbsp;are a must try if you&#8217;re around.</p><h4><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The only drawback they face is a little delay in deliveries due to lack of staff. Otherwise, the food is quite filling and doesn&#8217;t disappoint.&nbsp;Since they have delicious food, a large menu to choose from and is never heavy on your pocket, we can wait for it to turn up.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Pearl Academy and a few other colleges are nearby so you&#8217;ll mostly spot college students here or paying guests living nearby.&nbsp;They are mainly known for their spicy Chinese dishes but if you see the menu they also offer few Thai curries and seafood options as well. So when are you taking a bite of this?</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> G-200, Near PNB,&nbsp;Naraina&nbsp;Vihar, Naraina, New Delhi</p><p><strong>Say</strong> hello at +91 9210835524, +91 8860133130</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 400 for two people (approx.)</p><p>Explore&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/noodlecourt7/" target="_blank">Noodle Court</a></p><p><em>Representative Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p></div>
