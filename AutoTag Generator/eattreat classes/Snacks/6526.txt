6526	Majnu Ka Tila Is A Haven For Tibetan Food	<p>Delectable Reveries visited Majnu Ka Tila and took us with them. We came back in awe of the culture, the history and of course, the Tibetan food. Here&#8217;s what we found.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>The first thing that comes to mind after entering the colony (and that too every time) is “Hello Dharamshala!” An absolutely beautiful maze-like place&nbsp;which is the home to the sweetest people in the town, Majnu Ka Tila is always a delight to be at. It is decorated with vibrant prayer flags that have a different texture and a story of its own. Positive vibes, friendly people and comfort (and super cheap) food is all that this place has to offer and that is precisely why it is the most ultimate escapade for a day for any individual.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>A Muslim hermit by the name of Abdullah, popularly known as the Majnu used to ferry people across the Yamuna river for free as a service to God during the reign of Sikander Lodhi on Delhi Sultanate. Legend has it that Majnu met the Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev&nbsp;ji during one of such ferry rides and was further blessed by him for his selfless devotion. The Sikh Guru prophesied that history forever shall immortalise Majnu’s name, who was crazily in love with God.</p><p>This actually came true in the 18th&nbsp;century when Sikh Military Leader Baghel Singh built the Majnu ka Tilla Gurudwara to commemorate the stay in 1783.</p><p><img title = "Majnu Ka Tila Is A Haven For Tibetan Food  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6596" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mkt.jpg" alt = "tibetan Chinese Category:Snacks budget   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mkt.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mkt-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mkt-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mkt-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy </em>Of:<em> <strong>Ama Café</strong></em></p><p>Majnu Ka Tilla has three main residential settlements. These are the Aruna Nagar, New Arun Nagar and the old Chandrawal Village. This settlement came about in the early 1900s when the British Government provided accommodation to the labourers who were involved in the construction of the buildings in the Central Secretariat of New Delhi. The next round of settlement came about after India’s Independence in 1958. During that time, the Land and Development wing of the Ministry of Urban Development for the settlement of the people from northern part of Delhi developed the rather famous area of Aruna Nagar.</p><p>During the period of development of Aruna Nagar, the 1959 Tibetan uprising took place after the Dalai Lama went into exile to Dharamshala, resulting in people from Tibet to leave their country and settle in small refugee camps near the riverbed of the Yamuna River. The Government of India allotted this land to the Tibetan refugees in 1960. Many of the other refugees settled near the Indo-Chinese border but they had to come to these camps near the Yamuna River after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What To Eat?</strong></h4><p><img title = "Majnu Ka Tila Is A Haven For Tibetan Food  Majnu Ka Tila Is A Haven For Tibetan Food  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6598" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asian-kitchen.jpg" alt = "tibetan Chinese Category:Snacks budget   tibetan Chinese Category:Snacks budget   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asian-kitchen.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asian-kitchen-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asian-kitchen-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asian-kitchen-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Asian Kitchen</strong></em></p><p>If someone is looking for some authentic Tibetan food, this is it!
