4449	Things To Roast And Toast At Your Next Bonfire Party	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s gotten chilly way too soon? Planning a bonfire (even a smokeless one for these smoggy days) on one of these breezy nights? Confused about the menu?  Well, we’ve got it all sorted for you. Here’s a list of a few items you can roast at the party and raise a toast to. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>S’mores</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bonfire night and you can’t miss out on s’mores, can you?  Try a classic cheese or a chocolate cookie or a banoffee s’more for a light sweet snack.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sausages</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a cheesy twist to it, this is one of our favourites. Make a sausage roll filled with cheddar cheese, garlic and spring onions. Top it off with a chutney filling and some cheddar.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Potatoes</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect snack of the night &#8211; Baked Potatoes. Classic baked potatoes with a rich cheesy topping, these are pretty easily made. You can even make potato wedges instead with a spicy dip as its companion. These potatoes are going to run out sooner than you think! </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Toasted Marshmallows</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level up your game with toasted marshmallows and some chocolate fondue served along. This chocolate marshmallow is a feast of its own kind. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pork Chops</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roast a soft, tender pork with the smoke and some honey glazing or sweet mustard glaze for the perfect feast of the bonfire night.</span></p><p>We also love to put in all kinds of other veggies in there. Try roasting some marinated cottage cheese or chicken bits if you have some in the freezer.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of:<strong> Unsplash</strong></em></p>
