Just to be clear, these hors d&#8217;oeuvres even though small in size, often packs a punch with technique and complexity of flavours unlike, other finger foods like cheese sticks or french fries.

It is the canapé version of a bruschetta. Make a platter of these in advance to kick-off the celebration.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Buy pre-packaged crostini from your nearby bakery and stir up multiple toppings. Cut cherry tomatoes in half, mix with olive oil and basil for a burst of freshness. Garnish with parmesan cheese.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Add another twist to the platter with caramelised onions and goats cheese. Simply cook the onions in olive oil with salt and pepper, until they have that perfectly browned state releasing sweetness. Pair with crumbs of goats cheese to balance the flavours. If you are serving more refined palates, go for smoked salmon with cream cheese and garnish with chives. Serve on wooden boards to add that rustic vibe.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Quesadillas</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">This Mexican snack is filling, sinfully delicious and everyone’s mex favourite!</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Prepare your choice of filling (meat or mushrooms) by sautéing in pan with salt, pepper and paprika.

Once cooled, cut in desired shapes and crown with chopped tomatoes and sour cream.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Chicken Lettuce Cups</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">These Asian lettuce wraps make for refreshing, crunchy, flavourful canapés. They are so undemanding yet scrumptious, that we keep coming back for more.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Cook minced chicken in a pan with olive oil, add strong Asian flavours of red chilli, lemongrass, lemon leaves, ginger and soy sauce.

Place this humble filling in lettuce leaves {pre-cleaned and pre-washed} just before serving to avoid losing the freshness of the leaves.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Tuna Tartare Fishcakes</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">Fish cakes are similar to Spanish croquettes; a fish patty coated in breadcrumbs and fried. Make it the traditional Yorkshire way for a British addition to the menu or with a swift tuna tartare spin.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Boil potatoes until tender and mash with tartare sauce, spring onions, salt and pepper according to taste.

Serve with a tiny dollop of tartare sauce, garnished with dill on top.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Chocolate Mousse</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">No world theme can be complete without France and no party without chocolate! The combination of both, is this indulgent, decadent yet light dessert, that can be prepared in advance to serve when needed.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Melt chocolate and butter together, whisk in egg yolks and set aside to cool. Whisk egg whites in a separate bowl until soft peaks form and add sugar gradually until stiff peaks can be seen {try inverting the bowl on your head if you like to live on the edge!}. Fold through the chocolate mixture along with single cream for an impeccably light, fluffy mousse.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Layer chocolate ganache on the bottom and biscuit crumbs for an absolute dessert.
