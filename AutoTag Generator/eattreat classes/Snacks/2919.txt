Whether you are using cupboard packets to make a quick meal or starting from scratch to make a warm family dinner, eating pasta is a celebration. So here&#8217;s the&nbsp;guide to making good pastas:</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Italians take their pasta very seriously and so they should! But the knowledge about this beautiful staple is not as widespread. So go on, read our list of things you possibly didn&#8217;t know about the unpretentious pasta and tips to become a pasta pundit.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Pairing Pasta With Sauce&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Pasta is forgiving, but not when you pair it with the wrong sauce! Not all pasta shapes can go with every sauce, so its important you select the right combination of both.</p><p><b>#EatExtra:</b> Pair long skinny pastas, like spaghetti with light seafood or creamy sauces. Whereas, tube shapes like penne and rigatoni go best with hearty sauces or baked cheese dishes. Accompany tagliatelle, fettuccine and pappardelle with rich meaty sauces.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Pasta Shapes</strong></h4><p>There are over 600 hundred shapes of pasta and are known with over 1300 names. The three most popular shapes include penne, <a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/gastronomica-activated-charcoal-spaghetti-recipe/">spaghetti </a>and macaroni.</p><p><b>#EatExtra: </b>Some lesser known pastas include orzo (often known as barley, and used in soups), orecchiette (thumb pasta, one of the easiest to make at home) and tripolini (little bow-tie shaped, it is commonly used in salads).</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Most Pastas Have A Meaning Behind Their Name</strong></h4><p>Pasta comes from the word “paste” since the process of making pasta begins with making a flour and water mix. Similarly, most pasta shapes also have a strong significance behind their names.</p><p><b>#EatExtra: </b>Cannelloni literally means large tubes, farfalle translates to butterflies and lasagne comes from the latin word lasanum meaning chamber pot.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Homemade Pasta</strong></h4><p>Making pasta at home seems tedious but every effort comes to fruition when you roll out perfect sheets of pasta to form something as beautiful as a ravioli or simple as orecchiette. The most important thing while making pasta at home is using the right kind of flour. Normally when a pasta recipe states flour, it refers to finely milled “00” flour.</p><p><b>#EatExtra:</b> A simple trick to remember while making pasta is to combine 1 large egg for every 100gm of flour. Gently knead with love and affection for silky smooth pasta sheets.</p>
