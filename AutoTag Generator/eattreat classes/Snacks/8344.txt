8344	#SLAP Popcorn Has 5 Weird Flavours Including Mango Punch & Peri Fire!	<p>#SLAP popcorn&#8217;s&nbsp;come out with 5 weirdly flavoured Super Light American Popcorn and we tried all of them at the Palate Fest this time around. They’re fun new flavours, and each of them are intense, and they’ve got a superhero story to back them up. They just gave our favourite movie time snack an overhaul.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Sour Cream</strong></h4><p>It’s got this intense sour cream and garlic flavour and almost feels creamy on your tongue. It is still crunchy, but the flavours are like that. You should probably get a few bags of these instead of getting your usual potato chips.</p><h4><strong>2. Salty Sweet</strong></h4><p>It’s just the thing when you’re tired of getting caramel popcorn, and you just want a slight sweetness while still retaining the saltiness of the popcorn. You’re going to love this one and you probably won’t be able to stop at just one.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Peri Fire</strong></h4><p>We’d advise you to keep a glass of water with you while you’re munching on this, but where’s the fun in that? Peri Fire is so hot, you can feel the heat at the back of your throat while you’re taking breaks between munching. Make a little dip to make it an even better movie time treat.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Mango Punch</strong></h4><p>This one is a little tricky, for you’ll either love it or hate it. If you like it, you’ll notice that it has a slight, sweet mango pickle flavour, and it makes you want to keep munching on this as if trying to reach out to that jar of pickles that’s kept on the highest shelf.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Chilli Storm</strong></h4><p>This one tastes a little sweet, to begin with, but has the lingering heat from the chilli lingering on your lips. It’s not as spicy as the one with the Peri Peri, but it gets the job done.</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 20 per bag</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KadakSLAP/?fref=ts" target="_blank">#SLAP</a></p>
