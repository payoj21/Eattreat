6716	Kiwi, Pineapples, Guavas: Make Healthy Fruit Candies At Home With Dehydrated Fruits	<p>Several fruits come into season only briefly during the year, which means you’ve got to wait around months before you can sink your teeth in to your favourite fruit. If you’d rather have access all year round, dehydrating your fruit is a good way to go and here we have a healthy fruit candy recipe. They last for months and are one of the healthiest snacks to binge on.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Buying a food dehydrator is a good idea in the long run; it’s way more energy efficient than an oven, and can do large batches of fruit at a time. But for those of you who enjoy the occasional brush with dehydrating, an oven will do the job and save you the expense of an added gadget. Here&#8217;s what you have to do for getting this fruit candy recipe perfect.</p><p>Pick a fruit that’s in season, and make sure it’s ripe and firm. If you’re leaving the skin on, you need to rinse it well to ensure all the wax and pesticides are washed off. If you’re using stone fruits like pears and apples, pit and remove the seeds. With berries, you’ve just got to remove the stems. Cut the fruit evenly into small, 1/6 inch pieces.</p><p>Next, you should soak the fruit in water with lemon juice to keep it from losing its colour during the drying process. Soak for about 10 minutes, drain and blot dry.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bake Time!</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Discs-Dried-Citrus-Fruits-Dried-Fruit-Deco-Fruit-1455373.jpg"><img title = "Kiwi, Pineapples, Guavas: Make Healthy Fruit Candies At Home With Dehydrated Fruits  "class="size-full wp-image-6725" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Discs-Dried-Citrus-Fruits-Dried-Fruit-Deco-Fruit-1455373.jpg" alt = "sweet snacks healthy food healthy Category:Organics   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Discs-Dried-Citrus-Fruits-Dried-Fruit-Deco-Fruit-1455373.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Discs-Dried-Citrus-Fruits-Dried-Fruit-Deco-Fruit-1455373-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Discs-Dried-Citrus-Fruits-Dried-Fruit-Deco-Fruit-1455373-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Discs-Dried-Citrus-Fruits-Dried-Fruit-Deco-Fruit-1455373-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p style="text-align: left;">Preheat your oven to about 50-80 degrees Celsius (stick to a lower temperature for stone fruits, while berries can tolerate more heat). Line a baking tray with parchment paper, spread out the fruit evenly in a single layer—you can cover the top of the fruit with an additional sheet of parchment paper to keep it from curling up during the process—and start to bake. Flip and rotate every 2 hours.</p><p>While stone fruit will take about 6 hours till it’s ready, citrus fruits like oranges and grapes will take up to 10 hours, and berries up to 12. The fruit will turn leathery when done so you should be able to bend and tear it. Don’t let it dehydrate to the point where it’s dry enough to snap apart.</p><p>Once the fruit is ready, place it in an open glass container for about 4-5 days so that any remaining moisture can evaporate. Seal the container after 5 days and your dehydrated fruits should last you for an entire year!</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
