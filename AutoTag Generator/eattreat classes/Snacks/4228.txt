4228	All Major Cities Are Getting Dedicated Sanitary Street Food Zones	<p>Street foods are heavenly, but they are also associated with lack of hygiene and sanitation. Now, this puts us in a total dilemma! Whether to give into our temptations or empty our pockets in a two-star restaurant to have the same food. But worry no more. The Food Ministry has upped the ante in favour of food sanitation by promising dedicated street food zones in the city.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Our Food Minister is going to report to the government concerning reserved stall space and cleanliness. &#8220;Street food vendors issue is an important and serious matter for us. People sell street food in very unhygienic conditions. It is a big challenge. There is a need to reserve a street/space for vendors to sell street foods for which, state governments&#8217; support is required,&#8221; Paswan told reporters. Consumer’s health and food sanitation have been one of the major priorities in this drive. &#8220;I will soon write to state governments in this regard. I have discussed with some states,&#8221; he noted.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Clean &amp; Green</strong></h4><p>Paswan also mentioned that to make the cleanliness campaign a structured one, this initiative has been divided into two schemes &#8211; clean consumer fora and clean market &#8211; for the next two years. Under the Clean Consumer Fora, financial assistance will be provided to 600-odd district level consumer courts for food sanitation facility, he said. Under the clean market scheme, voluntary consumer associations will be affiliated and asked to adopt a marketplace where they can conduct their activities.</p><p>Along with this, they would also look into the matters of sanitation facilities for consumers as well as street vendors. A cleanliness campaign had been led by The Food and Consumer Affairs Department last month in relation to Swach Bharath campaign.</p><p>Along with this, they will also look into the matters of sanitation facilities for consumers as well as street vendors.
