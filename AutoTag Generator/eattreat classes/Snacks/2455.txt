2455	Café Lota Has Perfectly Captured Fusion Food With Hints Of Regional Love	<p>Amidst cool green canopies in a city that never sleeps and doesn’t let you, lies a sanctum for those who crave a little time away from the fast-paced realities of life. We present to you, Cafe Lota for fusion food and regional specialties.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Café Lota used to be the canteen at the Crafts Museum at Pragati Maidan, but has long since been revamped and is now a casual dining restaurant. Regional cuisine is served here from all parts of India. A few of the menu items are changed every few months. The restaurant is open for breakfast, and they also serve small and large plates later on in the day.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">Perfect Spot</h4><p>As one makes their way inside the Museum, one realises how natural light is fully exploited to create patterns while ventilating the entire space. The spot under the tree indoors that is decorated with fairy lights and lanterns is perfect for relaxing with family, or even with your group of friends.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/63682_247554012071167_684108886_n.jpg"><img title = "Café Lota Has Perfectly Captured Fusion Food With Hints Of Regional Love  "alt = "street food restaurant regional fusion food fast food Category:Snacks   "class="alignnone wp-image-2468 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/63682_247554012071167_684108886_n.jpg" width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/63682_247554012071167_684108886_n.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/63682_247554012071167_684108886_n-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/63682_247554012071167_684108886_n-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>The restaurant doesn’t serve alcohol, but their lemonade is delicious and goes well with almost every item on their menu. You should also try the many varieties of tea that they have in case you’re visiting on a cool rainy day.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>Sample the <strong>Sabudana Popcorn</strong>, the <strong>Chigudi Malai Curry</strong>, the <strong>Fish Tikka</strong>, the <strong>Himachali Tawa Chicken</strong>, and the <strong>Chicken Pasanda</strong>. A lot of thought and care has gone into making the menu and is clearly reflective in the dishes that are served at Café Lota.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>Parking is a huge issue, but if you’re willing to walk, you can park your car at Pragati Maidan metro station and make your way over to the restaurant. We also feel that the restaurant closes too early and so if you’re working through the week you can only go there on a day during the weekend and even then, it might be quite busy.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>Café Lota is definitely one of those places in the city that gives you an impression of a ‘safe haven’. It is a sanctuary for when you want to get away from the noises of the city. Once you’ve been there, you will find yourself wanting to go back whenever you can to Cafe Lota for fusion food and other delights.</p><p>Drop by at the National Crafts Museum between 8:00 am and 8.30 pm. The restaurant is closed on Mondays.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> National Crafts Museum, Gate No. 2, Bhairon Marg, Pragati Maidan</p><p><strong>Say Hello at </strong>078389 60787</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 800 for two</p><p><em>Photos Courtesy Of: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CafeLota/photos/a.222686747891227.1073741829.189221951237707/247554012071167/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank"><strong>Cafe Lota</strong></a></em></p>
