6378	Admire The Legend & Watch Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron At The Om Puri Tribute Night	<p>As the unhappy news came to the fore today, we have felt nothing but immense sorrow since. And it feels only a tad better than Delhi Talkies will be organising a tribute to Om Puri and his movies at Shahpur Jat&#8217;s <strong>Mumbai Matinee</strong> tomorrow, completely free of cost. And they&#8217;re also catering to your popcorn, maggi, chai and more during the screening.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>A perfect night out for movie buffs and celluloid connoisseurs, this tribute will be showcasing Om Puri&#8217;s extremely prolific work, <em>Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron</em>. The venue will also be doing a round of snacks and chai, but of course, the primary motive for us is to catch this excellent piece of literature from Om Puri&#8217;s colossal body of work.</p><p>The restaurant will also be offering Indian, Mughlai, Italian and Mexican fare. So come and pay your respects to Late Om Prakash Puri and admire his stellar work of 45 years once more.</p><p><strong>Head to </strong>4A, Mumbai Matinee, Shahpurjat, New Delhi</p><p><strong>On</strong> <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1364631811"><span class="aQJ">7 January at 8 pm</span></span></p><p><strong>Entry</strong> is free of cost but on a first come first serve basis.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/733071250185085/" target="_blank">Om Puri Tribute Night</a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>DNA India </strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
