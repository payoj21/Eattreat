3217	6 Pizza & Wine Pairings That Will Make Your Pizza Party So Much More Fancier	<p>Artisanal pizzas are the new &#8216;In&#8217; thing and what’s better to pair with a sumptuous&nbsp;slice of pizza than wine! Check out our list of wines you should be coupling at your pizza (pity?) party. Wine and pizza pairings: Here we come.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Margherita &amp;&nbsp;Rosé</strong></h4><p>A classic Italian pizza with tomato, mozzarella and basil is best paired with a more or less fruity flavourful Rosé. While choosing a wine with Margherita, remember that the pungent tomatoes should be the strongest flavour on the plate. If you want to opt for a red wine, go for something delicate and light.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Barbeque Chicken &amp;&nbsp;Malbec</strong></h4><p>The sweet smoky chicken with onions is best paired with Malbec which has strong notes of blackberry, plum, cherry and chocolate. If Malbec isn&#8217;t available, you can also try Pinot Noir or Merlot from the red wine selection.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Meat Lover&#8217;s Pizza &amp;&nbsp;Cabernet Sauvignon</strong></h4><p>A pizza loaded with meat comes to the rescue when all else fails (you know we are talking about that heartbreak). The rich and heavy toppings match perfectly with an indulgent red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon, high in acid and tannins.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pizza-1032057_1920.jpg"><img title = "6 Pizza &amp; Wine Pairings That Will Make Your Pizza Party So Much More Fancier  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3220" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pizza-1032057_1920.jpg" alt = "italian French fast food drinks Category:Drinks alcohol   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pizza-1032057_1920.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pizza-1032057_1920-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pizza-1032057_1920-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. Pepperoni &amp;&nbsp;Cabernet Franc</strong></h4><p>A meaty, spicy pizza slice like the New York Special Pepperoni deserves a full-bodied intense red wine like Cabernet Franc or Syrah. If you want something bubbly to cut through the heavy meatiness, Prosecco does that wonderfully.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. Hawaiian &amp;&nbsp;Riesling&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>The pineapple and ham Hawaiian pizza is one of our favourites (most people don&#8217;t share our excitement about it, but we welcome all opinions). The sweetness in the wine pairs beautifully with the sweet and sour flavour of the pineapple, while the acid cuts through the fattiness of ham.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>6. Veggie &amp;&nbsp;Chardonnay&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>A veggie pizza loaded with onions, bell peppers and mushrooms can be paired with unoaked Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. Unoaked Chardonnay tastes fresher, more acidic and fruity. It doesn&#8217;t have the usual creamy flavour and soft notes of wood and spice.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> If you can&#8217;t decide between the options, remember Zinfandel pairs very well with rustic and earthy pizzas.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixabay</strong></em></p>
