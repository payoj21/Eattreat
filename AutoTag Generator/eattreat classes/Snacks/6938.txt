6938	80 Years Of Classic Dahi Bhalle, Aloo Tikki & Chaat From Prabhu Chaat Bhandar	<p><strong>Dahi Bhalle Papdi</strong> is the epitome of a quintessential Delhi snack. These days, not many places have the ability to create that age-old combination of all the right ingredients in the right quantity. That is, unless you have been to Prabhu Chaat Bhandar, which serves probably the oldest and best chaat in Delhi. <strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong> took us through this journey.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>Located in UPSC lane, Shahjahan Road, <a href="http://www.thebetterindia.com/70538/visit-prabhu-chaat-bhandar-delhi-chaat-shop-80-year-legacy/">this establishment dates back to more than eight decades</a>. Their popularity has not diminished over-time, only risen. And why shouldn’t it rise? They have maintained the quality of their food over the years.</p><p>However, they do not serve just <strong>Dahi Bhalle</strong>; <strong>Aloo Tikki</strong> and <strong>Gol Gappe</strong> are also a part of their menu. I decided to have the <strong>Dahi Bhalle</strong> and noticed that proper hygiene was administered while handling the food which is a rare occurrence at Chaat stalls nowadays. Its taste was something to be appreciated. The coming together of spongy <strong>sooji bhalle</strong>, crispy papdi splashed with curd and both sweet and sour chutneys topped with bhujiya was incredible to say the least.</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV6VZU-Duvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Just Desserts</strong></h4><p>Since I already had a burst of spicy tanginess, I decided to opt for something sweet and ordered the <strong>Kulfi Faluda</strong>. I chose Kulfi Faluda over <strong>Gulab Jamun</strong> because it brought back many childhood memories and I can say that I wasn’t disappointed as I slowly savored each bite. The distinct rose aroma made it a nostalgic treat. I talked with a few customers and asked what their favorite snack was. A majority of them said it was the Dahi Bhalle Papdi followed by Aloo Tikki.</p><p>So, if you’re ever at India Gate, just strutting about looking for something fun to eat, you should pay this place a visit. Dahi Bhalle and Aloo Tikki are highly recommended and I would strongly suggest you to try the Kulfi Faluda if happen to have a sweet tooth.</p><p>This joint is open every day from 10 am to 8 pm.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> Dholpur House, Shahjahan Road, Near UPSC Office, Khan Market</p><p><strong>Say hello at </strong><span class="fontsize2 bold zgreen"><span class="tel" tabindex="0">+91 9810314063, </span></span><span class="fontsize2 bold zgreen"><span class="tel" tabindex="0">+91 9210013048</span></span></p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 150 to INR 200 for two</p><p>Explore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Prabhu-Chat-Bhandar-1618089231763986/?hc_ref=SEARCH" target="_blank">Prabhu Chaat Bhandar</a></p><p><em>This article was first published on <a href="http://www.delhifoodwalks.com/blog/prabhu-chaat-bhandar/" target="_blank"><strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong>.</a></em></p>
