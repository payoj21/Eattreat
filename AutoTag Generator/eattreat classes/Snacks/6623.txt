6623	Owl Is Well For All Your Late Night Hunger Pangs!	<p>Salt &amp; Sandals ordered from this late night delivery food delivery in Delhi called &#8216;Owl Is Well&#8217;, and told us all about it. Here&#8217;s the lowdown.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>What do you do when you come home late, tired and starving from work? Thankfully there are some great midnight delivery services that deliver fresh food in no time right at your doorstep. One of the most popular late night food delivery joints is Owl is Well in Greater Kailash Part-1.</p><p>What sets it apart from their counterparts is that they don’t compromise on food innovation and quality. Another major card in their favour is “packaging,” which, we believe plays a significant role when you are getting food delivered. Packaging should be inclusive of, heat resistance, tightly sealed hygienic boxes, tissues and spoons. This one had all of these requisites, which is commendable. Also, the presentation of the food was not comprised, considering the point it was a delivery product.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Talking About Food</strong></h4><p>The menu is smartly designed and it consists of a great variety of dishes. Most of them are those which we never imagined would get delivered at 3 am in the morning. Our <strong>Big Fat Greek Pie</strong> <strong>Pizza</strong> had thin crust, generous filling and a right touch of pesto sauce. Next on our plate was the <strong>Red Dragon Pizza</strong> which comprises three types of chillies and mouth melting cheese in it. It was followed by the <strong>Funghilicious</strong> <strong>burger</strong>. It which was loaded with mushroom patty marinated with herbs and spices, the patty was bit overdone and a better quality of bun can improve the fate of this dish. The <strong>Hangover Cure Burger</strong> stood out to be the main highlight of our meal. It is a meaty beast with barbeque chicken, fried onion rings, coffee glazed bacon, fried egg and candied jalapeños with gooey goodness of cheese. If you are trying to light on your stomach then their <strong>signature hot dogs</strong> and <strong>garlic bread</strong> is also a wise option from the menu.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">They operate from 11 pm to 3 am in the morning and you have a really bad craving for some tasty food, Owl is Well is here to get rid of all your midnight hunger pangs. Their menu consists of a variety of easy-eats including <strong>hot dogs</strong>, <strong>pizza</strong>, <strong>Shakes</strong>, <strong>burgers &amp; pasta</strong>.
