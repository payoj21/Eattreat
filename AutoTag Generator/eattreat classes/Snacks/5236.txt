While we didn’t figure the ‘Australian’ bit, we loved their outdoor seating. The outdoor section is quaint, and shut off from the outside world. They have a book collection, which you can borrow from or even donate your own books to. They also have free wi-fi, which makes it a perfect peaceful retreat to carry your work to. Try their </span>all-day breakfast, or pancakes. their iced teas are refreshing. our pick would be the <strong>apple with rosemary iced tea</strong>.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivyandbeanindia/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Café Turtle, Khan Market</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This little space is located above Full Circle Bookstore, and you’re most likely to find it peopled with a motley collection of foreign tourists, would-be authors typing away on their laptops, book lovers devouring their new picks, and the list goes on. The décor is not very loud, and the al fresco seating makes for perfect winter evenings. This is a vegetarian coffee shop, frequented by the who’s who of Delhi. Browse through the books at Full Circle, and then head upstairs for a cheesecake with coffee. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fullcirclebooks/?fref=ts" target="_blank">here</a>. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kunzum Travel Cafe, Hauz Khas</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A travel and book cafe where you can literally just ‘bum around’ on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

The only thumbs down is no wi-fi, or charging points but the interesting crowd makes up for the entertainment. Cha bar has an extensive list of teas on offer, and the all-time favourite cutting chai is priced at a humble INR 35-40. They also have some delicious sandwiches that you could try, other than some more snacks. A great way to spend time by yourself, just browsing through books and then following it up with tea!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChaBar.India/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sakley’s &#8211; The Mountain Cafe, Greater Kailash</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cozy, sunlit setup with a small library of travel books, Sakley’s is a great place for a hearty mug of hot chocolate, or sipping on a cup of coffee while flipping through the pages of the latest issue of your favourite travel mag.

A cultural cafe, Fursat se is a unique idea for a multifaceted cultural space that allows you to order from other cafes and restaurants. There’s a lot to do here, with monthly events like stand-up comedy, book readings, writing workshops and slam poetry. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fursatse/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Café Wanderlust, DLF Phase 4</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Café Wanderlust’s guiding philosophy is “Live To Travel. Live To Eat.” And we couldn’t agree more! A relaxed seating area (with hammocks!!) complete with travel books and an extensive menu with all-day breakfast, this one’s a must-visit when seeking some precious alone-time and a classic book cafe.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafewanderlust/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Another Fine Day, Gurgaon</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quaint café and reading room located on Golf Course Road in Gurgaon, Another Fine Day has an all-day breakfast, board games, books and great coffee too!

You’ll still get a decent coffee for a decent price nonetheless. Worth a visit!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/May-Day-Bookstore-Cafe-391790214176440/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Serendipity, The Claridges</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a treasure of fiction and non-fiction books to choose from, Serendipity offers every reader looking for a blissful ambience, that includes alcoves for reading besides other things like aromatherapy candles and perfumes.

We love the book-exchange cafe, XCO Cafe and Woodbox Cafe in Satyaniketan. Rico&#8217;s also has a healthy amount of books on their walls, in case you wanna sit and read something out of the ordinary.</p>
