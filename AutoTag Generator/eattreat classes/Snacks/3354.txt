Welcome to Sweet Street (curated by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EatTreatOnline/" target="_blank">EatTreat</a>!), where you’ll find everything from Indian sweetmeats to cakes and bakes. Cool Point is well-known for it’s <strong>Shahi Tukda</strong> and <strong>Phirni</strong>. Deep fried in pure ghee and served with a generous helping of thick cream, this is a perfect way to end your gluttonous journey. Made of milk and crushed rice, Phirnee is much lighter as compared to the former, but mouthwatering nonetheless.</p><p>There is a whole lot more planned for Foodistaan this year, we hear. There will be Taufeeq’s Biryani, chai from Singing Tree and a range of desserts. We’re can’t wait to find out more.
