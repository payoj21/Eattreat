3469	6 Bengali Delicacies For The 6 Days Of Durga Puja	<p>Since we love Bengali food and almost everything it constitutes, we decided to give you a list of 6 amazing delicacies to try this festival season. With lots of options, these are what you should be concentrating on so that you don&#8217;t miss out on anything!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Panchami</strong></h4><p><strong>Begun Bhajas</strong> or literally any kind of <em>tele bhaja</em> is our pick for the first day; keeping it light. Shallow fried brinjals or potatoes with a twist of <i>c</i>haat-masala or salt<i> </i>is a snack you can&#8217;t stop eating, be it with friends or family. Perfectly cooked Begun Bhajas are tender with a sweet flavour and the fine rice flour coating gives this snack a crispy twist.</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Panipuri_Golgappa_Phuchka.jpg"><img title = "6 Bengali Delicacies For The 6 Days Of Durga Puja  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3485" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Panipuri_Golgappa_Phuchka.jpg" alt = "north Indian festival bengali   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Panipuri_Golgappa_Phuchka.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Panipuri_Golgappa_Phuchka-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Panipuri_Golgappa_Phuchka-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shashti</strong></h4><p>We love ourselves some <strong>phuchka </strong>(Bong panipuri) on Shashti. Be it <strong>Mutton Ghooghni</strong> or plain old <strong>Masala Muri</strong>, Shashti is when we go out and try our tummies at eating street food.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Saptami</strong></h4><p>If you&#8217;re planning to eat bhog on each day, that&#8217;s fine by us too, but if you want to eat bhog on only a single day, Mahasaptami is your charm. <strong>Khichudi</strong> with multiple curries and fries, we like cleaning off the plate in the end with <strong>tomato chutney</strong>. Hot steaming <strong>Alur Torkari</strong><i> </i>is a traditional dish with a spicy flavour perfectly balanced with steaming hot <strong>luchis</strong><i>. </i></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ashtami</strong></h4><p>Ashtami is for rolls! Be it a <strong>double chicken</strong> or an <strong>egg mutton roll</strong>, Ashtami is the day when we experiment with Indo-Chinese street food. <strong>Chowmein</strong> with <strong>Chilli Chicken</strong> is a favourite, but you&#8217;ll also find us hovering at the cutlet and chop stall.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Navami</strong></h4><p><b></b><strong>Mutton Biryani</strong> with pieces of boiled egg or potato, cooked in dum is our pick for Navami. It has a unique aroma of desi ghee<i> </i>mixed with rich masalas that you can&#8217;t resist. Juicy tender pieces of mutton cooked in rice<i> </i>and sautéed spices make it a mouth-watering dish.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dashami</strong></h4><p>The last day, when our hearts are heavy, Bengali desserts are the only things that can make us feel better. <strong>Mishti Doi </strong>has a thick and dense texture, just like ice cream. With a pinch of ground cardamom or a few drops of kewra or rose essence, this is the perfect ending to all your heavy meals throughout Durga Puja. <strong>Sondesh</strong> is another loved and adored sweet.</p><p>Or you know, you could eat it all, everyday.
