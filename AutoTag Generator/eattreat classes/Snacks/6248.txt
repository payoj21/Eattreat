And let&#8217;s just say if you&#8217;re craving <a href="http://eattreat.in/hygiene-happy-needs-5-places-street-food-restaurant/">street food in Delhi</a>, then this restaurant is doing an amazing job.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>In a dynamic dining out scenario of Delhi where new concepts are blooming and restaurateurs are infusing a lot of innovations in their businesses, here comes a concept which will take you back to the roots of the food culture of the country. Masala Trail by Osama Jalali was recently launched in Janpath replacing Mumbai’s popular food chain Shiv Sagar.</p><p>The eatery is a tribute to the street foods of various regions from India and it comes from a well-known food critic and food consultant, Osama Jalali. A man who was born and brought up in the bylanes of Old Delhi and his ancestral roots in Rampur, a princely estate in U.P. Osama Bhai has spent his childhood amongst khansamas as his mother curates and cooks for the community kitchen. It is there, he developed his passion for food. With his vast knowledge, he has not only contributed to many publications but loves cooking himself and treating people over a chit chat about food and much more.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>An Ambience That Impresses</strong></h4><p>This restaurant is his joint venture of with restaurateur Vidur Kanodia and is all about the traditional Indian street food in Delhi. The focus is on simplicity in the way the food is cooked and presented so that the taste which is the real essence is not lost. The dim lit interiors, a huge artistic auto rickshaws mural made of silk sarees which adorns the wall and a Portable thela (street cart) on the ceilings are the highlights of the ambiance.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s On The Menu</strong></h4><p>The food is pretty reasonably priced and it’s the reason the place remains crowded all the time. Get refreshed with a range of Desi beverages, <strong>Modi Nagar Ki Shikanji</strong>, <strong>Aam Panna</strong>, <strong>Kesaria Lassi</strong>, <strong>Neer Mor</strong> (butter milk) to name some. One must try the <strong>Jigar Ka Thanda</strong> from the beverage list, a sweet mix of Ice Cream and Roohafza Sharbat. One should not miss the <strong>Banarasi Tamatar ki chaat </strong>from here. Blanched tomatoes cooked with roasted spices and topped with nuts and sev. The Sundae style served <strong>Tower Chaat</strong>, will remind you of the delicious Dahi Bhalla Papdi and other street food in Delhi.</p><p>Our favorite from the snacks section was <strong>The Pankhi</strong>, A light Gujrati delicacy wrapped around banana leaf served with tangy mint chutney. The <strong>Cholle Bhature</strong> are light and fluffy, served with tangy chick peas and with raw mango pickle, we assure you that Masala Trail will be your best choice to have Cholle Bhature. You will not find <strong>Sarson ka Saag</strong> and <strong>Makki ki roti </strong>more delicious than here, anywhere else in the city. The rich and robust flavors of saag topped with house made white butter with the corn roti cooked on tawa is a delectable combination. For the desserts, we highly recommend the <strong>Haji Ali Fruit cream and Kulfi Faluda</strong>, which are not very sugary but will delight your sweet tooth.</p><p>Masala Trail is the next game changer in the restaurant scene of Delhi. With its reasonable pricing and extremely palatable street food offerings it’s a place that one can visit on a regular visit. Do visit and be assured to leave with a belly full and a smile on your face.</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href="http://saltandsandals.com/india-platter-masala-trail-osama-jalali/" target="_blank">Salt &amp; Sandals</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Image Courtesy Of <strong>Masala Trail</strong></em></p>
