5903	Cheese You Should Have On A Simple Antipasto Platter To Make Snacking Classy	<p>A simple antipasto platter can alleviate your party to poshness when served with the right cheeses and accompaniments (after all who doesn&#8217;t like cheese). So, this year we are here to guide you through it and help you impress your guests like a true cheese connoisseur!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Aged Cheddar</strong></h4><p>Everyone loves cheddar, this sharp aged cheese is well known and great to lure the sceptics (though we don’t know anyone who doesn’t like cheese, myths exist that such people do exist and we are set out to change their opinion). It pairs well with rye bread, olive oil crackers, English mustard and olives stuffed with garlic. Black currant, apple and wild grape jams also complement sharp cheddar well. A simple antipasto platter usually has this one.</p><p>Wine Pairing: Malbec, Zinfandel &amp; Cabernet Sauvignon.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Opt for aged Gouda or Emmental in case cheddar isn&#8217;t available or you want to stir things up.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Brie</strong></h4><p>One of out most adored and versatile cheeses, we never serve a simple antipasto platter without brie. Gooey and soft, this mild cheese can woo anyone. While this cheese is very forgiving and can be paired with just about anything (or eaten on its own) we love pairing it with apple slices, dried apricots, fig and berry jams. Raspberry, cranberry, strawberry all work very well by cutting the creaminess of brie with their acidic hit.</p><p>Wine Pairing: Chardonnay, Chilean Pinot Noir &amp; Champagne.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Don’t be afraid to eat the rind of brie cheese, it might taste a little bitter but is very much edible. If your local vendor has run out of brie then go for Camembert or Coulommiers, both exceptional soft cheeses.</p><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/antipasto-food.jpg"><img title = "Cheese You Should Have On A Simple Antipasto Platter To Make Snacking Classy  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6253" src="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/antipasto-food.jpg" alt = "snacks Kitchen italian chef cheese Category:Snacks   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/antipasto-food.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/antipasto-food-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/antipasto-food-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/antipasto-food-825x493.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pixnio</strong></em></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Manchego</strong></h4><p>A firm buttery cheese from Spain, manchego is made from sheep’s milk and has a grassy aroma. It pairs beautifully with Spanish Tortas de Aceite (sweet, flaky biscuits), Membrillo (quince paste) and chorizo, enhancing the Spanish experience. An apple and horseradish jam go quite well with this cheese despite the funky combination. You can also serve with a drizzle of honey to those you enjoy desserts before meals.</p><p>Wine Pairing: Rioja, Meritage &amp; Tempranillo.</p><p><strong>#EatExtra:</strong> Substitute manchego with Monterey Jack or Gruyere in case you want to go with the obvious choice.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gorgonzola</strong></h4><p>While stilton is the preferred choice for many when it comes to blue cheese, we enjoy gorgonzola much more. Try pear jam, green tomato chutney, plum and mint preserve or honey as accompaniment and while marmalade is not always a suggested pairing we do quite relish it (so, give it a whirl?). Nut bread and dates can also do the trick by adding sweetness to this strong cheese.</p><p>Wine Pairing: Barolo, Cabernet &amp; Sangiovese.</p><p>Explore more cheese and wine combinations <a href="http://eattreat.in/perfect-pair-wine-cheese/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><em>Featured Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Pexels</strong></em></p>
