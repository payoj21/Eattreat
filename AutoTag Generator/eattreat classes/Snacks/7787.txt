7787	Nagpal Chole Bhature In Amar Colony Is A Saviour For Students & Localites On A Budget	<p>Nagpal Chole Bhature Amar Colony is one of the most famous chole bhature places in Delhi. <strong>Delhi Food Walks</strong> gives us an insight into the inner workings of one of the happiest places around Lajpat Nagar.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;“… Yaar tune yahan ke chole-bhature nahi khaye? Sharam kar!</p><p>And with this, my friend greets me into the haven of all the ‘PG people’ in and around Amar colony. This was one place where the&nbsp;undying-Punjabi-love-for-choley bhature&nbsp;was conspicuous. Be it a South Indian girl standing at the counter and ordering two extra plates to take for her PG mates after having one whole herself, or be it my bong friend who did the awesome job of bringing me here, Nagpal Chole Bhature Amar Colony fits all tastes and preferences very well.</p><h4><strong>How It All Began</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220.png"><img title = "Nagpal Chole Bhature In Amar Colony Is A Saviour For Students &amp; Localites On A Budget  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7857" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220.png" alt = "punjabi Indian fast food drinks Category:Snacks budget breakfasts   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220.png 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220-300x180.png 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220-768x460.png 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220-825x493.png 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220-410x246.png 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4220-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Coming back to the place from&nbsp;where all the mesmerisation started, Nagpal Choley was found in 1990 in the same Amar colony area where it is operational till now. In contrast to the current scenario, it was started with just one main dish which was the (evergreen) choley bhature. Looking back to those times this enticing plate consisting of a big bowl of choley with 2 huge bhaturas was merely priced at INR 8.</p><p>And this is where one of the in-charges there, Ramesh, says that ever since the time he has joined as a worker here, all he has been observing is the sheer increase in the customers as well the prices. With 2 years away from completing its 25th&nbsp;year of existence, Nagpal Choley has been catering to the tastes of a huge chunk of people situated in Amar Colony by serving them with a wide variety of the fried Punjabi flavour. Their dishes range from special Nagpal choley bhature, poori choley, rajma-rice, shahi paneer-rice, samosa with chutney and steaming kachoris. They also have lassis in fantastic flavours. Mango being our favourite.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223.png"><img title = "Nagpal Chole Bhature In Amar Colony Is A Saviour For Students &amp; Localites On A Budget  Nagpal Chole Bhature In Amar Colony Is A Saviour For Students &amp; Localites On A Budget  "class="alignnone wp-image-7859 size-full" src="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223.png" alt = "punjabi Indian fast food drinks Category:Snacks budget breakfasts   punjabi Indian fast food drinks Category:Snacks budget breakfasts   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223.png 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223-300x180.png 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223-768x460.png 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223-825x493.png 825w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223-410x246.png 410w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4223-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p>Undoubtedly, Nagpal choley has emerged as the most sought after food point in Amar colony due to their reasonable prices in terms of the quantity and quality they offer.
