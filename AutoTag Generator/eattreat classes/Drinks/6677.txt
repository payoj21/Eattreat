This place also serves sheesha so you can try that as well, just in case you like having one. These dim sums were good in flavour but due to some unforeseen circumstances in the kitchen that day, these dim sums couldn’t be filled properly and were a little overcooked. They had a different version of typical <strong>Pav Bhaji</strong> and it was really tasty, the taste of bhaji was spectacular.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p><a href="http://eattreat.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/billiards.jpg"><img title = "Take A Trip To The Medieval Ages At Lord Of The Drinks In CP!
