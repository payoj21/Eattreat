5093	#HeyRum // Ever Wondered Which States Love Drinking Rum In India?	<p>Old Monk is by far the most<a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//heyrum-old-monk-indias-love/"> favourite rum of our country</a>, and for good reason. This vanilla-scented golden liquid packaged in the iconic cubical bottle has many memories attached to it. And, of course, drinking rum in India the best thing that’ll help you get through the biting cold of the Delhi winter.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>We dug a little to find out how much it is that we Indians really drink, and it turns out that according to data that was collected in 2010 by Business Standard, Kerala tops the list of states who drink rum in India! They not only include it in making the copious amounts of Christmas cakes around this time of the year, but they also consume it on a daily basis.</p><p>About 53% of their total alcohol sales in Kerala are attributed only to rum. This means that people in this state drink enough to account for about 6.3 litres of rum per person per annum. The average monthly sale rounds up about 8.2 lakh cases. It is cheap, easily available, and people from all economic strata drink it. The consumption of rum is growing at an average rate of 7% annually in this state.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On Rum Being The Favourite In Indian States</strong></h4><p>Only second to Kerala are Bengal and Orissa, that account for about 30% each of the total alcohol sales in their states. South India, as a whole, seems to prefer whisky and brandy over rum; and the north Indian states seem to like their whisky more, the exception to this being the Northeastern states who consume beer more. The states on the western side of the country like their locally produced liquor a little bit more than the rest.</p><p>The southern districts of Kerala seem to consume more IMFL than the rest of the state. Chalakuddy, a town near Thrissur, accounts for daily sales of about 5-7 lakh Rupees, and during festivals like Onam and Christmas, this figure goes up to about 15 lakhs. It’s no surprise why those cakes are so boozy!</p><p>It’s a known stereotype that the uniformed men contribute to the overall rum consumption in the country and the sales form about 65% of the Canteen Stores Department’s alcohol sales. One would majorly find McDowell’s Celebration Rum, Old Monk and Contessa apart from local brands here. Overall, 35% Indians consume alcohol in the country, 14% of which consume rum. Which means, that 5% of the total population in the country that is made up of 2.83 billion people love their rum.</p><p>Check out the rest of our rum campaign <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//old-monk-indians-drink-rum/">here</a>.</p><hr /><p>You can check out how much we have immersed ourselves in our love for Old Monk, <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//love-letter-old-monk/">this is what </a>you should be reading.
