7644	These 12 Hot Chocolate Places In Delhi Will Heat You Up During Chilly Evenings	<p>We do love our cup of hot chocolate in this weather, and we can&#8217;t do without a few cupfuls to get us through the day. Winter is when we bring out all the supplies to make our own cup,and go out scouting to look for places where we can comfortably sit and enjoy one when we&#8217;re not really up to entering the kitchen. Here are some of our favourites when we&#8217;re out to get hot chocolate in Delhi</p><h4><strong>1.
