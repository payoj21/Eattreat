5548	No Mo Car-O-Bar: Liquor Stores Banned On Highways Come April 2017	<p>The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a ban on the sale of liquor on all State Highways, stating that all licenses of liquor stores in and around the National Highways will be closed post March 31, 2017.</p><p>The apex court came down heavily on States for not heeding the Centre’s advice to not issue licenses to the vendors on the highways.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Things First</strong></h4><p>The move comes after the court indicated on Wednesday that the court will order the shutting down of all liquor stores on highways for safety and security of commuters who get “distracted” after seeing shops, causing accidents. Liquor stores must be at least 500 metres away from state and national highways.</p><p>Last week, the court had expressed concern over 1.5 lakh deaths every year in road accidents. Petitions had requested a change in rules to ensure that alcohol is not sold on highways.</p><p>The bench headed by Chief Justice TS Thakur expressed its unhappiness over alleged inaction by various states in removing liquor stores alongside roads which gives rise to drunken driving and consequential accidents. The three-judge bench also ordered that all liquor banners and ads be removed from near highways.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What&#8217;s More?</strong></h4><p>The Punjab government had asked the court for permission to allow liquor shops near or under elevated highways, to which it received a strong rebuttal from the bench which said “Look at the number of licenses you have given. Because the liquor lobby is so powerful, everyone is happy. The excise department is happy, the excise minister is happy and the state government is also happy that they are making money.”</p><p>Generating revenue cannot be a “valid reason” for governments to allow the sale of liquor along highways. This is a welcome move, considering nearly 1400 accidents and 400 deaths take place every day on Indian roads according to one of the petitions, which means 17 deaths every hour.</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/no-liquor-to-be-sold-on-highways-from-now-on-supreme-court-orders-116121500233_1.html"><strong>here</strong></a></em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong></em></p>
