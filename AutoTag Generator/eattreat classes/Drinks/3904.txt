You can get this in traditional 650 ml bottles (at about INR 70), and 330 ml bottles. Currently, you can only get this in Goa, so now you know where to head to for your next vacay!</p><p><em>Read the full story <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/self/the-old-monk-super-beer-deserves-a-big-gulp-before-winter-takes-over-yes-it-exists-264039.html">here</a>.</em></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong><a href="http://www.mbdrinks.com/old-monk-10000-super-beer.html">Mohan Meakin Breweries</a>&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Pixabay</strong></em></p><hr><p>You can check out how much we have immersed ourselves in our love for Old Monk,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//love-letter-old-monk/">this is what&nbsp;</a>you should be reading.
