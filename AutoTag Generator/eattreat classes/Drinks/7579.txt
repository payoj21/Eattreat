7579	5 Ideas For Anti-Valentine Dinners If You Think Valentine’s Day Is Overrated	<p>We at EatTreat believe in giving complete freedom to your fancies, when it comes to February 14 every year. A lot of us like doing the<a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/5-valentines-day-ideas-for-a-romantic-date-in-delhi/"> traditional candle-light dinner </a>with our respective SOs or going out with friends, just to feel a little less alone. BUT incase you&#8217;re staying in or calling BS on Valentine&#8217;s Day, alone or otherwise, here are some alternative anti-Valentine dinner ideas.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>1. Easy Dips &amp; Crackers</strong></h4><p>We are very strong proponents of Netflix and chips. So if you have no plans whatsoever for V-Day, we can recommend these <a href="http://eattreat.in/magazine/easy-dip-recipes-impromptu-party/">awesome dip recipes that you can make under 10 minutes</a> and hog on for the rest of the night while watching every sappy rom com (nay, historical documentaries).
