5133	#HeyRum // 5 Dark & White Rums We Love Other Than Old Monk	<p>We have an unconditional and unapologetic love for the Indian classic Old Monk, but that’s not all there is to rum. This fermented molasses is produced prominently all around the world (though it’s not all cheap) and some of them are  worth trying. We have chosen our favourite dark rums and white rum for you. And if you are in an adventurous mood this season, go check them out!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Appleton Estate, Rare Blend 12 Years Old</strong></h4><p>In production since 1749, Appleton is Jamaica’s Old Monk. A deep bronze colour with gold tint, it has a constantly evolving taste. Recorded to have a vibrant orange peel flavour with subtle mocha and caramel hints, it surely is a rare blend.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Angostura 1919</strong></h4><p>Produced in Trinidad and aged for a minimum of 8 years in American oak bourbon barrels, this deluxe aged blend has an interesting story behind it. As recorded by the company, “After a fire in 1932, which destroyed the Government Rum Bond, the master blender of Fernandes Distillers, J.B. Fernandes, bought the charred casks, only to discover they had been filled in the year 1919. The prized rum was skilfully blended and called 1919 aged rum.” How can we not try this after reading the story!</p><p>We hear Spencer’s Gurgaon might be stocking up on these over the next two weeks!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Havana Club 7 Year Old Rum, Anejo</strong></h4><p>This dark Cuban rum is another popular choice in winters. Full flavour and rich, it has a good balance of sweet vanilla and toasty oak as recorded by Stuart P. Considered sophisticated and elegant amongst the counterparts, it has quite a following.</p><p>Along with Angostura, Havana Club will also become available at Spencer’s!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bacardi Superior (White Rum)</strong></h4><p>White rum is commonly used in mixers due to its slightly sweet flavour. The Bacardi Superior has soft notes of ginger and coriander with a citrus aroma, making ideal for mojitos. It also matches well with coke if you don’t want anything fancy!</p><p>Available at Spencer’s Gurgaon for INR 2200 (1 litre)</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>El Dorado 15 Years Old Rum</strong></h4><p>The badass Mexican name is what lured us towards this rum and we were quite delighted to have chosen it. Produced in Guyana, it has been awarded gold medal in Caribbean Rum Taste Test 7 times, as recorded by The Whisky Exchange.
