There is nothing truly more comforting than this silky and creamy shot of warm milk loaded with cocoa. Whats better than a hot chocolate to give you company during those lingering winter nights? Absolutely nothing! While<strong> Cadbury instant chocolate mix</strong> has remained a childhood favourite and a handy go-to, (I actually quite loved downing that extra sugary mug of ready-to-mix Cadbury hot chocolate made by mum, before school, each morning), churning out the real stuff at home is an unbelievably easy experience.</p><p>So, to make hot chocolate at home calls for some legit cocoa (we suggest Dutch processed). Once you have this hero ingredient in hand, you’re almost sorted. Once you’re done making the DIY hot chocolate mix, you can store this in an airtight container for up to five months (but don’t expect it to last that long, after all). So follow our guide below and make hot chocolate from scratch, at home, like a pro!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>How The Pros Do It?</b></h4><p>While hot chocolate is remains a simple yet classic mash up of rich cocoa and warm milk, over the years, acclaimed culinary masterminds have pimped out their formulas to make this liquid chocolate heaven &#8211; even more addictive.</p><p>When it comes to hacking that life changing hot chocolate recipe, we trust no one more than <strong>Chef Jacques Torres</strong>. For those who are alien to this name- Jacques Torres is a James Beard award winning pastry chef who gave up his glittery restaurant job to open his very own chocolate factory in Brooklyn (that’s true, our man is really obsessed with the idea of good-quality chocolates). Today he owns several candy stores where he sells his delicious and premium range of assorted chocolates, peppermint barks, hot chocolate fudge sauce and a lot more. Jacques likes to use 60-70% dark chocolate for his dark chocolate with a surprise addition of corn flour and milk powder (his secret ingredients).</p><p>On the other hand <strong>Martha Stewart</strong> likes to keep it simple; using only cocoa and milk, while <strong>Jamie Oliver</strong> gets sneaky and adds a generous dose of his secret ingredient- Horlicks to make the hot chocolate richer and creamier.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hot Chocolate In Delhi</strong></h4><p>Coming back to where we are; while researching for this article I happened to stumble upon an uber talented and young Delhi-based patisserie blogger, who recently did a complete series on hot chocolates! Gayatri Sakhuja, 22, is the writer and baker behind the delicious and decadent blog<a href="http://www.thedessertproject.in/" target="_blank"><strong> The Dessert Project</strong></a>. Her series of hot chocolate include some incredibly rich and boozy flavours such as: <strong>Baked hot chocolate</strong>, <strong>Mexican hot chocolate</strong>, <strong>Baileys hot chocolate</strong>,<strong> Classic hot chocolate </strong>and <strong>Peppermint hot chocolate</strong>.
