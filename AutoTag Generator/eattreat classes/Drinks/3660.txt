The Mutton-Keema Pao is unexpectedly delicious with spicy<strong> Keema Bhajji</strong> mixed with Indian spices with the crisp pao definitely their best signature dish. The Moroccan Fish was tender, with a crisp covering served on a couscous rice bed and coriander leaves in a tangy paste. The presentation and quality are unbeatable.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect to beat the heat their <strong>Watermelon Smash</strong>, <strong>Cucumber Lemonade</strong> and <strong>Panache</strong> are refreshing and cooling. Panache was a mixture of orange juice, mango juice, mint leaves and grenadine whereas the other two were signature Impromptu cocktails that are more popular with the crowd.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sweet Tooth</strong></h4><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSC03747.jpg"><img title = "Impromptu In Gurgaon Is Killing It With Their Fun Cocktails &amp; Glass Exteriors  Impromptu In Gurgaon Is Killing It With Their Fun Cocktails &amp; Glass Exteriors  "class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3666" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSC03747.jpg" alt = "north Indian non vegetarian gurgaon European Buffet Brunch   north Indian non vegetarian gurgaon European Buffet Brunch   " width="847" height="507" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSC03747.jpg 847w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSC03747-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSC03747-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slice of gooey flourless chocolate cake which melts in your mouth. Served with vanilla ice-cream, this one was the perfect ending to a great meal. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a hard one as everything was top-notch. From food to ambience to service, everything was a delight. However, their<strong> Chicken Skewers</strong> were a little dry and the sauce served with it was a little disappointing. </span></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve got some amazing packages like Sunday Brunches (INR 699), Buffets for Lunch (INR 785) , Live Music on alternate Saturdays and imported drinks at great prices. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drop in at Ground Floor, Vatika Towers Complex, Golf Course Road, Gurgaon</span></p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong>Shreya Ahuja</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
