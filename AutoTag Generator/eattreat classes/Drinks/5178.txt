5178	#HeyRum // 3 Simple Reasons Why Winters & Old Monk Are Soulmates	<p>When someone says rum, the first things that come to our mind are Old Monk, winters, the navy and pirates! Rum and winters have a connection that comes from the long past. Often used to keep warm, cure cold and soothe the throat, its rich flavour is what we crave when the temperature drops.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dark and Smoky</strong></h4><p>As the sun goes into hiding and the fog sets in, the dark nights become ideal for sipping something <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//5-white-rum-love-old-monk/">strong but smoky</a> and that’s where rum comes in. Everyone has their own way of drinking rum, some enjoy aged dark rum which you can sip and savour, while others like chugging a<a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//hey-rum-mixers-rum-drinking-party/"> lighter one with coke</a>. In either case, they enhance the experience of winters.</p><p><a href="http://recipes.timesofindia.com/articles/features/citys-rum-rate/articleshow/7253269.cms" target="_blank">In TOI</a>, Shourabh <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shourabh Sitaram, owner of Tabula Rasa says that dark rum is the elixir of winter. &#8220;People also like to have Orange Rum Punch, which is a drink that has cardamom and cinnamon. There is a 40% increase in the consumption of rum in winters. That&#8217;s an average of two bottles per day, and five bottles when there is a party.&#8221; </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Warms It Up. Or Does It?</strong></h4><p>But here is a myth buster tho. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking alcoholic beverages makes you feel warmer, it is believed but in fact it does the actual opposite. Rum doesn&#8217;t actually keep you warm or prevent hypothermia. The core temperature of your body is lowered as well. </span></p><p>Here&#8217;s what happens: Rum is a vasodilator. It makes your blood vessels dilate (especially the capillaries just under the skin) and the blood rushes to your skin, making you feel hot. It also destroys your body&#8217;s capability to defend your core temperature since all the blood moves towards your skin. So it can be quite dangerous to drink rum in the cold weather. But as we say, everything in moderation!</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Taste Of Old Monk</strong></h4><p>Rum is made from <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//heyrum-old-monk-indias-love/">sugarcane by-products</a> or directly from sugarcane by the process of fermentation followed by distillation. The distilled product is then aged in oak barrels which gives it the smokiness we all love so much. While each rum has its own flavour and body (the explanation of which we shall leave for connoisseurs), this drink (like Old Monk), on the whole, has a very distinct caramel or molasses undertone we enjoy.</p><p>The main rum records “In 1655 Admiral Penn of the British fleet captured Jamaica from the Spanish and authorised the locally made sugarcane spirit to replace the official beer ration.” That is the extent to which Navy loved rum, so who are we to say it’s not good enough!</p><hr /><p>You can check out how much we have immersed ourselves in our love for Old Monk, <a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//love-letter-old-monk/">this is what </a>you should be reading.
