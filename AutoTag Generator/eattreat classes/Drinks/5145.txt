It has a very slight flavour so as to not empower the entire dish. The dish itself is pretty delicious and has some of this sauce poured around it, but who wouldn’t want an extra helping of anything that’s spiked with whisky, amirite?</p><p>Explore them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paralleldel/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lord Of The Drinks Chamber</strong></h4><p>We’ve heard some great things about the <strong>Chef’s Favourite Vodka Infused Grilled Prawn Shaslik</strong> that comes with <strong>Beetroot Rice</strong>, where they’ve marinated the prawns in lemon, coriander, and vodka.
