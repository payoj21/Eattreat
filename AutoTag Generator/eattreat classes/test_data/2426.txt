2426	Dig Into The Gorgeous Zucchini Fries & Amazingly Thick Shakes At Diggin	<p style="text-align: left;">Diggin is the place where we head to after a hard day of work. Their coffee and zucchini fries are enough to blow your mind while comforting you. So we had to write this Diggin Cafe review, for those who still have to pop in for a visit.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></h4><p>A spacious old-school café spread across two floors and outdoor seating space, Diggin serves delicious Italian and Continental fare. Located on the busy Siri Fort Road, it sees a lot of walk-ins from the next door neighbours, Gargi College and Kamala Nehru College.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>The best time to hang around the space is late afternoons on weekdays. If you are going out with your family for a weekend dinner, reserving a table is highly recommended.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>Strawberry Cheesecake Shake. We could drink it every day for the rest of our lives!</p><p><a href="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/08/10945785_836069229824584_6534006383099721333_o.jpg"><img title = "Dig Into The Gorgeous Zucchini Fries &amp; Amazingly Thick Shakes At Diggin  "class="alignnone wp-image-2436" src="http://www.eattreat.in/magazine/magazine//wp-content/uploads/2016/08/10945785_836069229824584_6534006383099721333_o-300x180.jpg" alt = "snacks pizza pasta italian continental Category:Snacks cafes   " width="917" height="550" srcset="http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/10945785_836069229824584_6534006383099721333_o-300x180.jpg 300w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/10945785_836069229824584_6534006383099721333_o-768x460.jpg 768w, http://eattreat.in/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/10945785_836069229824584_6534006383099721333_o.jpg 847w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /></a></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>Crispy Zucchini Fries, Lamb Lasagna and Spaghetti Bolognese are always on our repeat order as well as Diggin&#8217;s bestseller lists. End it with your pick of freshly made gelato.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>The pizzas can be a little too crusty for our liking. And if you&#8217;re not animal-friendly (which we hope you aren&#8217;t), then keep an eye out for the neighbourhood cats and dogs.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>The perfect place to go for a date to. Mood lighting, retro posters and the large swing just seal the deal for us.</p><p><strong>Head to</strong> No. 1 Anand Lok Shopping Centre or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/diggincafe">here</a>!</p><p><strong>Say hello at</strong> 011 4080 0081</p><p><strong>Pay</strong> INR 800 for two</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy Of: <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/diggincafe/photos/a.540887672676076.1073741829.469531179811726/836069229824584/?type=3&amp;theater">Diggin</a></strong></em></p>
