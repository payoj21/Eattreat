2314	Do Indian Bartenders Need To Be Good Listeners? Ek Bar’s Nitin Tewari Tells All	<p>On a hot summer day, the Eat Treat editorial team spent the better part of their Saturday afternoon ensconced in the <a href="http://eattreat.in/ek-bar-new-menu-indian-street-food/">cool environs of Ek Bar </a>happily sipping on a good half-dozen beautifully crafted cocktails by the most talented mixologist in town—Nitin Tewari.</p><p>Here’s what he has to say about customers returning <em>baar baar</em>.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On their most potent concoction</strong></p><p>A shot called <strong>Gas Chamber</strong>–a combination of absinthe, Blue Curacao, vodka, and alcoholic fumes.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On barmen being the best listeners</strong></p><p>Yes, even in India. Being a good listener is quite an important part of a bartender&#8217;s job.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On handling a difficult customer</strong></p><p>This one always works. I’d usually like to serve a <strong>Flat Liner</strong>, which is a combination of sambuca, tabasco and vodka.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On nursing hangovers</strong></p><p>A glass of fresh lime water or more alcohol aka a <strong>Virgin Mary</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On drinking on the job</strong></p><p>Never. But as a part of my profession, I have to taste every single cocktail before it is served to the guest.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On the item you can cook up yourself</strong></p><p>The <strong>City of Nizam</strong> – the Ek Bar twist on gin and tonic. Take gin, add a few pieces of turmeric and set aside for 2 hours to infuse. In a glass, add 60 ml of the turmeric-infused gin, and add sugar and salt as per your taste. Squeeze in some orange juice and finish off with tonic water.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>On his personally favoured bar spaces</strong></p><p>I love visiting PCO for their cocktails and Summer House Cafe to chill out. But my bar at home is the best!</p>
