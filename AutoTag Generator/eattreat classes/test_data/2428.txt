And we know just the place to find it.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In a Nutshell</strong></h4><p>Located in the heart of the city, SodaBottleOpenerWala is one of the very few restaurants that serves Parsi cuisine. It is now open at three locations in the NCR — Khan Market, DLF Cyber City, and their latest outlet in the Mall of India Noida. One can easily spend hours at the restaurants (whichever you pick!), that are decorated with vintage artefacts like flower cans, soda bottles, mirrors with ornate wooden frames, and wooden chests. To add to the authenticity, there are jars and tiffin boxes filled with biscuits and candies placed at the tables.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Perfect Spot</strong></h4><p>The best time to visit SodaBottleOpenerWala for Parsi food in Delhi is during late afternoons or early evenings when it is comparatively quieter and breezy. The pretty light fixtures and vintage decor make the seating area outside a perfect place for a date night.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Raise A Glass To</strong></h4><p>SodaBottleOpenerWala certainly doesn’t disappoint when it comes to the different flavours that their cocktails offer. The Brandied Bawi, Mummy Nu Double Dose, Sol Of Colaba, are some of the drinks that you must try.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>On The Silver Platter</strong></h4><p>The menu is a lavish yet simple affair filled with delicacies. Interestingly enough, the Bun Maska and Maska Pav are served in tiffin boxes, which transports you to the streets of Mumbai. You should not miss Aloo Aunty’s Vegetable Cutlet, the Chicken Farcha, the Berry Pulao (both kinds) and the Dhansak Mutton.</p><p>We also have a special spot for the Eggs Kejriwal that transports us back to the olden Bombay times.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bitter Pill</strong></h4><p>Since there’s limited seating, you might have to wait for a bit to be seated on a busy weekend. They don&#8217;t take reservations, so go early, if possible.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food For Thought</strong></h4><p>All in all, SodaBottleOpenerWala is one place you should not miss if you’re on a night out in the city and you want to try something new.
