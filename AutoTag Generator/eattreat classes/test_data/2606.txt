2606	Traditional & Simple Modak Recipe For A Happy Ganesh Chaturthi	<p>This is that time of the year when everyone is busy for the 10 days of Ganesha’s stay, starting from Ganesh Chaturthi to Anant Chaturdashi. <em>Modak</em> is made as an offering to the Lord of Wisdom and is quite the sweetmeat we love ourselves. It can be made in several ways using rice flour and refined flour with varied sweet fillings.  Here I have given my mother&#8217;s traditional recipe of <em>modak</em>.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Elements:</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">1/2 kg refined flour</p><p style="text-align: center;">2 tablespoons refined oil</p><p style="text-align: center;">2 medium-sized coconuts</p><p style="text-align: center;">1/2 cup milk</p><p style="text-align: center;">Cardamom powder</p><p style="text-align: center;">300 gms sugar</p><p style="text-align: center;">Handful of almonds</p><p style="text-align: center;">Salt, to taste</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>Knead a dough with refined flour, salt, refined oil and water, and leave it covered for 3 hours. Break the coconuts and grate the flesh to a fine texture.</p><p>Cook the grated coconut on a slow fire along with milk, sugar and cardamom powder till all the liquid gets absorbed and a heavenly aroma starts tingling your senses!</p><p>Keep this mixture aside and let it cool.</p><p>Make small roundels of the refined flour dough and roll them out. Fill the coconut mixture in the rolled out dough.</p><p>Now carefully pinch your fingertips into the dough so as to make petals. Twist the dough from the top and seal it by pressing the remaining dough together.</p><p>In a frying pan, heat the oil and fry the <em>modaks</em> on medium heat till they are golden brown in colour. Make sure the insides of the dough also get cooked properly.</p><p><strong>This article first appeared on <a href="https://kulinarykapers.blogspot.in/2014/09/ganeshas-favouritemodak.html" target="_blank">Kulinary Kapers</a>.</strong></p>
