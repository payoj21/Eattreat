starchy tuberous crop popularly known as the potato this dish is considered incomplete in the city of calcutta the awadhi biryani history as the morning sun drowns the sounds of the fajr prayer reverberating from the nakhoda masjid on chitpur road the masalchis kitchen helpers at the royal indian hotel located right opposite the imposing mosque prepare the restaurant for its avid clientele amidst the busy thoroughfare with attarkhanas perfume shops dawakhanas pharmacies and crowds of people jostling for space the tantalising smell of the biryani emanating from royal is a treat to the senses photo courtesy of royal india hotel the biryani served here is what is known as the awadhi or lucknowi style popularised by the nawabs of lucknow established in 1905 the royal indian hotel boasts of having inherited the recipe from the antecedents of its first cook abdur rahim who were rakhabdars chefs of the royal imperial kitchen who cooked only for the nawabs unlike the khansamas who cooked for the nawabs retinue to wajid ali shah this recipe has now been passed down through generations allowing royal to remain a calcutta institution for over a hundred years photo courtesy of oudh 1590 it is prepared in the ‘dum style where the bottom of the handi or cooking vessel is first layered with meat and rice is added on top the vessel is then covered and sealed with dough in order to make it airtight and is cooked on slow flame over a considerable period of time cooked without the customary aloo potato and the egg the subtle taste and the nongreasy light appearance of the dish

what is now the calcutta biryani has an interesting historical trajectory the last nawab of lucknow wajid ali shah was dethroned and exiled to calcutta in 1856 by the british the story goes that along with his entire entourage including khansamas and bawarchis he settled in metiabruz receiving a yearly stipend of 12 lakh rupees per annum from the british government was not enough to feed his cortège photo courtesy of arsalan hence the alooa cheap local substitute for the expensive meat made its way into the awadhi biryanimore as a place of proxy than of pride and behold the birth of the calcutta biryani the addition of the boiled egg was probably an olive branch held out by the nawab to calm the frayed egos of his followers #eatextra for a succulent version and our favourite of
