 guppy has been and will remain one of the best seafood restaurants in delhi to get sushi and an amazing katsu curry but this winter guppy has outdone itself with its fantastic winter menu that is every bit filling and comforting in equal parts in a nutshell guppy has been around for a while but whenever we find ourselves nearabouts lodi then this is a wonderful spot to have a comforting lunch the quirky colour really lifts up the space during the mornings and we hardly ever go here during the evenings but we are sure its lovely all the same the new winter menu blows other seafood restaurants out of the water perfect spot the best place to sit here is near the windows when the sun is streaming in right next to the bar you can also speak to the barkeep and watch the wonderful sushi rolls being created from scratch the teal and pinks of the space are nice to sit in anywhere else as well the outside area has a tanabata tree to give you shade during the summers raise a toast to we got the kiwi mojito which was super refreshing and is a great palate cleanser when you have had something particularly pungent the hazelnut coffee shake came in a martini glass and was bit too sweet for our liking though with all the spicy stuff you may need it on the silver platter starting with the lobster and seafood soup kaminabe and it was enough to fill the two of us up so if you want to try a bunch of stuff then this wo not be a super good idea but if you love seafood and want tonnes of it this is it coming in a cute paper pot the lobsters were fresh and juicy if salad is your poison of choice then the tuna and avocado poke will be an excellent addition to your order the radish adds that pungency and the buttery avocado melts in your mouth the slow cooked tuna steak is the star and we recommend it wholeheartedly the tuna is wellcooked and comes with a poached egg and tangy sauce if an easy appetiser is wanting on your table then the sushi rice crisps are perfect they are not like your usual sushi rolls but are crispy on the outside a bit like sushi pakoras if we may the battera sushi comes with different toppings and we loved the eel one the best the chicken ramen is a really great substitute for our usual katsu heathy and hearty this one is great as comfort food with corn veggies eggs and chicken strips we had love this on a chilly evening bitter pill the mushroom toban yaki is not for everyone the peculiar essence of mushroom would not be preferable to all but if you are a mushroom connoisseur this is a great way of getting acquainted with some rare varieties food for thought guppy and a winter menu go beautifully together end with a warm carrot cake or matcha pudding and feel your heart fill up with love for the japanese cuisine and seafood restaurants coming soon head to 28 main market lodhi colony say hello at 011 2469 0005 pay inr 2900 for two explore them here photos courtesy of guppy guppyâ€™s slow cooked tuna steak has killed and taken us to seafood heaven
