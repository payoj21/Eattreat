 we all agree that old monk is our favourite because it keeps us warm in the winter its cheap makes the yummiest of drinks and can be added even to dessert but what really goes into this wonder drink lets find out molasses rum is made of byproducts of sugarcane like molasses and is even made of sugarcane juice by fermentation and distillation it is then put in oak barrels with charred to agewhich gives it that smokey flavour and fragrance that we all love there is no particular type of sugarcane that is used to make rum but it depends on the place and laws in the area where it is grown and where the distillation takes place yeast before distillation comes fermentation yeast and water are added to the molasses or sugarcane juice to start this process many distilleries add specially cultured yeast to control production time and the taste while others use wild yeast at this time alcohol since it is a dark rum old monk contains about 42% alcohol by volume abv which means that in every 100ml of rum 428% is purely sugar that has been converted into alcohol flavourandand colour old monk has a distinct vanilla flavour and fragrance any kind of flavouring is generally added during the second distillation to control how it tastes in the end the only time old monk adds caramel is during the bottling process and only to control the colour and consistency since old monk is a dark rum it is aged in heavy charred casks or barrels made of wood that comes from oak trees ageing in these vessels not only gives rum its mouthfeel but also a certain smoky character and more importantly its colour so white rum is aged in stainless steel vats while dark rum like old monk is aged in oak barrels this is true for all other types of alcoholic drinks as well #heyrum whatâ€™s inside your old monk
