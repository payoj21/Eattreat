bucket list of artsy activities we visited the bangalorean dialogue in the dark its located on the top floor of phoenix marketcity at whitefield the only thing that can be seen from outside is the reception desk and a couple of cushioned chairs the receptionist welcomed us to the “unique experience” of dialogue in the dark she explained to us the concept of dialogue in the dark and rules and regulations that we needed to abide by if we were to enter the restaurant we agreed and then she presented us with the menu the menu consists of only four items to choose from – the veg starter platter non veg starter platter smart pops veg and non veg platter – which is the fancy name for threecourse meal we opted for the non veg starter platter what went down as soon as we registered for the unique dark dining experience we were provided with the key to a locker we were advised to keep all our belongings – wallets phones watches and bags in the locker no light emitting object was allowed inside the restaurant after we were done keeping our belongings safely in the locker the receptionist opened a security door for us which was fingerprint activated we stepped into another realm – the realm of darkness darkness pitch black darkness not even a single speck of light a voice welcomed us from the darkness she asked our names where are we from and what we do then she told each of us to put our hands on the shoulder of the person in front us the first person in the queue followed her inside we all trailed behind one another forming a human chain she lead us inside the restaurant we could not see anything it was like as if we were in the deepest of sleeps the voice told us the directions to take once we were near the table with a bit of difficulty we sat down voices of normal conversations filled the air around us “dialogue in the dark” – it all made sense food fantasy and fun water bottles were served to each of us we tried feeling the table the chair the plates around us with our hands it was like all the other senses were working in hyper mode food was served to us within ten minutes or so the same voice that guided us to our tables helped us to feel the food with our hands first came the starters now it is a policy of the restaurant not to disclose the menu as it would spoil the suspense we would love you to try out and explore the vegetarian and non veg menu by yourselves and its actually fun to try and guess the food that you are eating without looking at it nose tongue and fingers – these three senses combine and give an extremely unique experience we had our starters main course and desserts one after the other we conversed with each other we heard other people converse finally we completed eating our food that voice returned she enquired about our experience and asked us to try and guess the menu we got few of the items right we were very eager to know that how actually she was able to see us guide us and serve us food in that pitch black darkness the most common thought will be that the waiters had some kind of night gear which enabled them to watch in the dark but the truth is far from it she promised us to tell her “little secret” once we were out of the restaurant we left our seats eagerly we again followed her voice this time she let us outside first specks of light door opened finally light what we saw next amazed us the voice that voice the voice which guided us and served us our food – that voice was of a woman a special woman – blind woman yes our guide in this darkthemed restaurant was a blind woman in fact all of the waiters who served in the restaurant are blind we stepped into their world for a short duration of time inside the restaurant it was actually kind of a role reversal where the blind guided the ones with the eyes that is the very essence of this wonderful experience that realisation and experience and that non veg platter will be etched in our memories for a very long time the waitress told us about the rigorous training she went through before being able to serve and make all the customers happy we had nothing but appreciation for her finally we took our belongings from the locker adjusted ourselves to the realm of lights and went forward to our normal lives explore them here photos courtesy of dialogue in the dark enjoy veg and non veg platters in pitchblack
