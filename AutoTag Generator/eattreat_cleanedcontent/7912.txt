 we recently made our way over to bikaner house to check out the jammu and ladakh food festival at chor bizarre and we have to say we were quite impressed in a nutshell chor bizarre is a newly opened restaurant by the people who own hotel broadway in daryaganj at bikaner house and serves kashmiri food the entire place is decorated with artefacts from all the chor bazaars of india chor bizarre is easy to locate but do not go by their facebook page or google maps unless you want to land in the middle of old delhisomething we had to learn the hard way the restaurant does not serve alcohol but does serve some interesting mocktails which you are going to read more about they are open for lunch and dinner and close for a few hours between the meal times before they commence operations for the evening perfect spot theres no one perfect spot to sit at here you can choose wherever you want to be seated depending on how many people you are going to be accompanied by but if you like vintage tribal jewellery you might want to sit at this one table by the bar that has a glass top and has neatly laid out metal jewellery laid out for anyone to see on the silver platter we had the good fortune of being able to get a few things from both the regionsladakh and jammu the chef started us off with a hot bowl of gyathuk the ladakhi flat noodle soup which was nice and meaty and just what we needed after our little adventure before we finally reached bikaner house next we got the kaladi kulcha from the dogri menu jammu which was made with a special type of homemade cheese and was just the most delicious snack to have for mains from the ladakhi menu we got timok of both vegetarian and nonvegetarian kinds which came with tiny little tingmo bread the curry itself was nice and flavourful and the tingmo was a nice accompaniment for them we also got the ladakhi pulao which is generously topped with caramelised carrots and onions and the chutagir which is a delicious and flavourful stew made of lamb dumplings made of whole wheat flour potatoes peas and spinach the chef also sent in some of the dogri specialities which included the khatta meat that is served with a khameeri roti the meat was so soft and well cooked it fell apart when we first took a bite out of it and the khameeri roti made with yoghurt and refined flour looked a lot like a bhatura and was just as soft they also sent us bowls of khatte rajma which had this slight tang to it and maa ki dal ka madra which was dal makhani cooked in yoghurt and topped with lots of raisins and fried slivers of almonds to end it on a sweet note the chef sent us a small bowl of sun dried apricot stewed in apricot syrup with a scoop of vanilla ice cream this dessert came in from the ladakhi menuandif you have wanted a dessert thats not too high on the sugar factor this is it the dried apricots and the ice cream went very well together and we do not think we want to have plain old vanilla ice cream the usual way ever again they also sent meetha chawal a dogri speciality it was so well made each grain of rice was separate this was topped with raisins and fried slivers of nuts and was flavoured with a little cardamom it was a nice end to a perfect meal raise a toast to since they do not serve alcohol we got a couple of their mocktails the adraki punch was nice and spicy and the imli mirchi mary was well interesting to say the least if you really like your bloody mary you might want to try this one out we also got a glass of their fresh watermelon juice which was nice and refreshing bitter pill while everything was delicious at some points of time we felt that the meat dishes tasted a little similar also they had sent in kachalu chaat yam and we had expected it to be warm and soft but it was the opposite probably because its a vegetable the drinks too were not as cold as we had expected them to be the momos on the ladakhi menu were not anything special but these are just minor discrepancies and our overall experience was wonderful food for thought so what we are saying is that you absolutely must head to chor bizarre to try all the delicious food on their menu this food festival that ran for a very brief time gave us a taste of the specialties of surrounding areasthe menu was specially designed by members of the royal family of ladakh their usual menu has kashmiri food which is beyond amazing head to bikaner house pandara road india gate say hello at 9910601574 explore chor bizarre thereâ€™s a ladakh food festival happening at chor bizarre and now the hills are calling us
