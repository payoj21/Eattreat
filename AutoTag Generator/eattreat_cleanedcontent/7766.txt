 thank the medieval turkish soldiersand for being the first people all those centuries ago to have come up with the idea of kebabs now fast forward to the modern day and here we have kebab gali new delhi a quaint little restaurant serving a plethora of well no surprise there kebabs kunal khurana takes us to this spot which is doing some amazing stuff in a nutshell having been invited to a bloggers meet at one of their branches malviya nagar couple of days earlier i got a firsthand experience of some of their delicacies and without keeping any suspense i should say they were outstandingandbut lets have a comprehensive view first the restaurants location at corner market malviya nagar is somewhat tricky to notice at the first go being sandwiched among other establishments but once you enter it is comparatively quiet and absolutely welcoming for oneself perfect spot there is seating arrangement for about 30 people give or take so its not strictly speaking a big place however thats one thing that i personally like in an eatery because in my experience the bigger the place the lesser they give attention to details but of course exceptions are always there now coming back to the topic there is ample lighting which gets a big thumbs up from me and the decor is apt according to the theme the staff and most importantly the owner who was present during the bloggers meet was absolutely forthcoming and helpful in every way he also gave a brief description of how each dish is prepared in their kitchen and how they make their own blend of secret spices tell you the truth getting to know all these details really fired up my taste buds and made every dish seem like all the more delicious on the silver platter the very first dish we started with was chicken garlic tikka andat first glance you may think its only chicken malai tikka but wait till you taste it and you will notice the subtle difference that a whiff of garlic can make another thing to be said here and that goes for every single dish that rolled out in front of me was that the plating and presentation was always spot on and deserves to be mentioned separately then came the shikhampuri kebab which were as much a delight to the tummy as they were to the eyes such perfect eclipses of food goodness i tell youandthe next dish that came out really had me amazed and in awe it was the chicken chapli kebab such tender pieces of spiced meat that the moment you pick them up they just crumble then and there i think i almost finished the whole plate by myself this was followed by galouti kebab that came on top of neatly cut pieces of warqi paranthas personally i am not a fan of this style of kebabs as i find them too malleable but that does not take away the fact that they were cooked to perfectionandnext came the dohra kebab they are called so because they are actually mutton kebabs that are wrapped around with a layering of chicken kebabs thereby given double the taste from two varieties of meat together i also got myself the mutton nihari which was decent enough before settling down for chicken biryani towards the last leg of the meal to wind up things on a grand note as for the need of satisfying the sweet tooth i tasted the extrasweet shahi tukda and also the gulab jamun and thats how a royal kebabi feast came to an end head to and78 corner marketandmalviya nagar new delhi say hello at 088001 89131 payand inr 600 for two people approx explore kebab gali and photo courtesy of kunal khurana this article first appeared on kunal khuranas website kebab gali brings you dozens of different kebabs for you to drool over
