 we have loved smoke house delhi in hauz khas vasant kunj saket and cyberhub and of course theres nothing like a taste of the familiar in a central location like connaught place the ambience of the spot is consistent with the other outlets but also grants you a sneakpeek into the older world that cp was than what it is now in a nutshell photo courtesy of smoke house delhi still doing a very european menu smoke house deli keeps on giving the spot has opened right next to croma in the odeon complex and the small entry section opens up into a large halllike area that reminds one of an oldworld coffee house the entry area has high tables next to the bar and deli and the hall area is the main restaurant the walls of which have been embellished with graffiti spraypaint art and doodles around the theme of connaught place and its history perfect spot we picked one of the side table in the main hall but we believe that the elevated area at the end of the restaurant gives a nice view of the entire place and is nicely lit up for you to have a quiet romantic dinner raise a glass to the melon kiwi lemonade or the mojito is a great pairing to wash down all those fresh greens or the creamy pastas you can also get a juice or coke to keep it simple on the silver platter we could go on and on about the various starters and mains but we will restrict ourselves to the good bits the chicken noodle soup is excellent and comes with crispy noodles chicken mushrooms herbs and spices in a bowl and a broth that you can pour out the wild mushroom soup is a perfect accompaniment with all the bread and the heat of the pepper makes it a great comfort meal the salads were just right in our opinion the californian oranges and grapes with the passion fruit dressing has the right balance of sweet and savoury from the goat cheese we also tried the grape and toasted chia seeds with fig dressing but it was a tad too sweet we recommend you dive right into the wild mushroom risotto or the my bosss style spaghetti aglio olio the pastas are al dente and the lamb and horseradish burger is the epitome of juicy no really we had to get another plate the hazelnut mousse is a perfect end to this gluttonous meal if we may bitter pill we have not tried any of the alcohol yet so the jury is out on that the flourless chocolate cake was slightly gelatinous the cheesecake is drier than usual but the blueberry compote it comes with is stellar food for thought we hope you try out the new smoke house and we can assure you that we are dropping back in during the day to try the sandwiches from the deli see you there drop in at ground floor odeon d block connaught place explore more here photo courtesy of eattreat team smoke house deli is now open in cp and hereâ€™s everything we tried
