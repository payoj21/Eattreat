 bill bryson once said “to my mind the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted” the concept of old is gold might be applicable in certain situations but when it comes to food and travel in india exploring novel concepts is foremost we start looking at things with a different perspective and each and every voyage be it far or near gifts us with new visions and sights travel living and food i feel food and travel in india are inseparable i always look forward to the food specific to my destination and so do many others over the years there has been increasing enthusiasm when it comes to gourmet food safaris and culinary trips and for once the usual becomes boring for example if you are visiting france you might find indian restaurants serving surprisingly delicious and authentic indian food but if you do not have a croissant and black coffee for breakfast or a croquemonsieur for lunch your trip to this gastronomical paradise is left incomplete if you do not try out the aguaymanto and camu camu peruvian fruits on a voyage to peru have you really explored the culture as deeply as you could have exploration begins at home i stand by the belief as deborah carter put succinctly you have to taste a culture to understand it people are becoming increasingly interested in tasting new cuisines it could be a way of diverting themselves from the mundane as well as understanding different cultures and i personally believe that a separate culinary trip or a food destination travel in india though extremely interesting is not exactly the only way of exploring new sites in your own city a simplistic one day or half day food trail is also just enough for you to get drunk without regret following the next day in fact m any groups in bandra and dadar in mumbai or even old delhi organise food trails to get people to know how special their heritage is without being extravagant the sincerity the passion the hard work which people put in cooking and the skills which they apply can be truly appreciated by visiting the home kitchens and smaller businesses food travels to you too whenever a new cuisine hits the market a foodies heart skips a beat people especially indians are keen on trying out tastes of different lands be it korean or konkan rigidity and conservatism have taken a backseat and the likes of k ale quinoa and greek yoghurt have been welcomed into homes the misconception that western or any cuisine other than indian is unhealthy and can harm us and we can safely say that thats absolutely not true the oats and cornflakes with which we start our day are foreign concepts and still dominate our breakfast menu do you know that a mediterranean diet is considered the healthiest and is followed by many hollywood and bollywood stars talking of hollywood celebs they are the greatest brand ambassadors of health foods influencing people worldwide to travel to know about these foods innovations are good innovations are necessary for the chefs as well the customers chefs worldwide have been fusing exotic unexpected ingredients and people are loving it and dessert savoury mix have been their favourite fusion goals recently with the invention of cronuts croissant + donut cinnaburger hamburger + cinnamon roll and coneoli where t he outer deepfried shell of cannoli is substituted for an icecream cone6u i believe how much ever authentic the food maybe in a restaurant but if the food prepared is not made with the ingredients of that particular region where its origins belong it can never be as justifiably delicious for that either one has to go to restaurants which import ingredients that are certainly expensive yet worth it or travel to that place observe and comprehend what factors could have led to the creation of the dish the peculiar smell of the surroundings and aroma of the spices many times even the way the food is cooked can be reflected in the way people live or have adapted themselves to their environments travel in india and elsewhere makes turns you into a storyteller travel gifts you with memories you cherish for a lifetime and leaves you with an appetite for more so travel as much as you can cause “zindagi na milegi dobara” taste culture to understand it travel in india and elsewhere for good food
