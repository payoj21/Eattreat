 if you are that person whos made a million whatsapp groups for that trip to goa but nothings ever materialised you have our sympathies but now you can get a taste of the shack life right here in delhi ad singh of the olive group has opened a very colourful very ‘hep restaurant that serves hearty fun goan cuisine in delhi in a nutshell lady baga is a goan shackthemed restaurant built over two levels serving goan cuisine in delhi its located where monkey bar once used to be in cp they have got a threesided bar projections of waves on the walls and sand to make it feel like you are actually at the beach brocade blouses adorn the wall near the bar and they have made a water curtain that makes you feel like you are at the beach and listening to waves crashing against the shore if you happen to be seated near it the entire vibe of the restaurant is very friendly and the peppy music is loud but it just makes you feel right at home it is certainly one of the few happier places we have been to in the city the seating arrangement ranges from hammocks to sunbeds cane chairs and wooden deck chairs the entire restaurant is covered in retro colours and popart styled artwork you can see origami stars and fairy lights suspended from the ceiling in the lower level and theres a place for hookahsheesha upstairs apart from an outdoor seating arrangement perfect spot the best place to sit here is in the outdoor area where its a lot quieter you can see parts of connaught place from here while actually being able to hear people when you are trying to have a conversation but if thats not really your concern sit at the lower level at the area where they have put wooden deck chairs closest to the bar so you can see the projections on the walls while getting high on the many cocktails they have on their menu on the silver platter the best part about shack food in goa is the fact that they not only have authentic goan food on the menu but also a few dishes from here and there you can start with the yellow submarine handcut fries with a dip of the day and when you have got the munchies a platter of papad cones raw mango pickle goas famous masala kaju and charred recheado pineapple to go with your drinks next get the prawn lonche and the all you need is chilli fry calamari that comes with a cafreal dip they are both so good get father lorenzos chorizo with pav bread if you love yourself some pork you can just sit with this and finish the entire thing by yourself while having that delicious chorizo ask your server for the pie chart which is a vegetarian pie of the day the stuffing changes each day and we got the one with cheese spinach and mushrooms the choux pastry is so nice and light it crumbles as soon as you touch it with your fork if all of this is not enough get the neighbours best kept secret that you can have with either red rice or panpole goan version of the neer dosa we got the mutton one and loved every spoonful of it the mutton pieces were so well done that they fell apart when we touched them for dessert get sticky fingers and the baga bebinca the classic goan dessert that anyone whos ever been to goa brings back each time raise a toast to as soon as we settled down at our tables we were greeted with a couple of shot glasses and were called the ‘ acid test so they have put two differently flavoured bottle shaped shot glasses in a big whisky glass topped with ice one of them is flavoured with jalapenos while the other is flavoured with kokum you can just keep having these but you are sure to get high very quickly get moonshine and hooch if you are missing goas feni the mixologist here has developed vodka with palm and cashew and they are both smoother than feni next get bloody marianna this chorizo infused bloody mary is so amazing you can never go back to having bloody mary the same way if you love your scotch whisky and love the flavours of ginger they have put the two in a cocktail called the ginger man our friend who generally avoids cocktails fell in love with this one yes it was that good now you ca not have completed the goa experience without having port wine get their port wine sangria called ‘ a sangria at every port its got goan port wine red wine grape juice vodka cointreau apple juice and spices that are all put together and aged for a considerable amount of time you are never going to go anywhere else for sangria if you have a taste of this also get the baga bong which is a great sundowner its got white rum dark rum lime grapefruit passionfruit and cointreau we are pretty sure you can understand how tipsy one can get if you have had all of these drinks but then again when in goa do as the goans bitter pill the music on the lower floor can be a tad too loud so if you are trying to have a conversation you should move upstairs but thats not too big a deal because you will definitely enjoy the peppy music here and recognise old favouriteswe were greeted by the macarena food for
