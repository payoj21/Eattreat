 indian food freak takes us through a tour of vegetarian in cyberhub for the first time with their tastings of burma burma read on to find more other than the khao suey – one dish soup meal – not many of us know much about burmese cuisine given the location of burma now known as myanmar its cuisine is influenced by chinese indian and thai cuisine which most of us loveandburma burmaandis a mumbaibased restaurant which has recently opened an outlet in cyber city gurgaon burmese cuisine extensively uses fish sauce and fermented seafoodand howeverandankit gupta the proud ownerpartner of burma burma whose mom comes from burma decided to keep his restaurant completely vegetarian in cyberhub not only vegetarian but vegan though the restaurant may not be publicised as such hence one will find abundance use of peanut coconut and black gram flour in most of its preparations burma burma has cafe type warm interiors with a little bar counter there is no alcohol but different variety of teas the bulky menu has almost half of its pages dedicated to the variety of teas showing how seriously they take their teas we start with a couple of mocktails – andoh no tamarindand andand spiced gingerand both of which are very refreshing oh no tamarind has tamarind pulp jaggery and coconut shavings and spiced ginger is a mix of ginger mint lime green chilly and mint these are served with salted sunflower seeds – an addictive snack that is very popular in myanmar for jains and more the menu has a few dishes specially catering to jains with no oniongarlic i am yet to come across any other restaurant in gurgaon that indicates jain dishes a good gesture i must say the andsamuza hincho inr 220 is a samosa soup which is a very popular street food in myanmar the samosa is dunked in a cabbage and carrot tangy soup of black gram kala chana with the samosa adding to the bite and flavours andtohu hinchoand is the nutritious bean curd soup with tofu both the soups are nice with my taste buds more in favour of the samuza hincho salads and health foodand the choice of salads is quite impressive wanting to try different varieties we chose the trio of salad thoke samplerandat inr 480 i learnt that 80% of the tea production in myanmar is used in making thoke salad we first try theand mandalay laphet thoke laphet means “green tea” and thoke means “salad” – the salad is an eclectic mix of flavours and textures that includes soft pickled tea leaves crisp roasted peanuts and other crunchy beans toasted sesame seeds and fried garlic laphet is so important to the culture that when tea leaves are harvested the best of the crop is set aside for fermenting while the rest is dried and processed for drinking teaand tayat ti thoke andis the raw mango salad with roasted red chilly brown onion and crushed peanuts andand naykar gyun akyawand has sunflower leaves and crispy wheat flakes each salad is different from the other i believe tea salad is an acquired taste that we will have to get used to but for my first visit i loved the texture and crunch given by wheat flakes in sunflower leaves salad appetisers galore in the appetisers we try theand paukse andsteamed bun the variants are priced at inr 300 each for 4 buns if you are in the mood to eat something spicy then try theand brown onion and roasted chilly paukse though we enjoyed the subtle flavours ofand mushroomandpaukse more there are 6 types of khao suey that are served in burma burma every community has their own version of this traditional dish we tryand shwedagon khao sueyand inr 370 that does not come with different ingredients on the side it is a thick variant of noodles served with gram flour tomato curry and thick coconut cream next time i will try the signatureandkhao sueyandat burma burma tohu mok palata andinr 320 is a great value for money dish basically it is shan tohu burmese tofu cooked with onion tomato and spices the texture is something like the dry yellow urad dal it is served with flaky burmese parantha that resembles our malabari parantha when the tastetexture is so similar it is very difficult not to like this dish anyone who likes coconut and peanut will love this dish –and ohn thaminand inr 340 which is coconut rice served with peanut tomato chutney a very comforting dish we end the meal withand oh no na nat thi coco pinaand inr 270 the caramelised pineapples are served with chilled coconut custard and some flavoured foam an excellent dessert indeed the day we went the restaurant was all full with waiting outside service was indifferent and lacked at times i hope they make an improvement on this ground soon i am no authority to comment on the authenticity of this cuisine at this restaurant myanmar has not too many fine dine options so
