 the darzi bar and kitchen launched a little over two weeks ago and has already started catching a lot of eyes for its decor and the concept of tailormade food and drinks they are one of the newer theme restaurants in delhi that aimandto give its customers a unique experience in a nutshell the darzi bar and kitchen is designed on the concept of a tailor shop from the streets of saville row in london the interiors are exquisitely intertwined with an aesthetically appealing ambience the food and drinks are bespoken and some of the dishes on the menu are even paired with the drinks that they have on offer at the moment they too do not serve alcohol but they soon shall once the liquor licenses come in they serve regional indian foodand the restaurant is located on the first floor and the entrance may seem like a mystery at first unless someone guides you in the entire restaurant is covered in tailorthemed motifs one wall is entirely covered with tabletop sewing machines while another has cascading drawers some of the tables here look like spools of thread and there are sections where there are thick ropes that make a gridlike pattern to represent the wefts and warps that make up fabric both the floors have a bar area additionally the lower floor has a very stylish cigar lounge and the upper one has an outdoor seating arrangement where you can order hookah they also have lockers on the walls for safekeeping for when you have had one too many and accidentally leave your belongings like your wallet keys etc whats more is that they have a small stage area for live performances which they plan to have every week perfect spot we do love sitting outside but it can be a bummer in the summer you could sit at one of the tables on the upper floor where theres more seating space or at the bar below the speciality of the bar on the lower floor is that its designed in a way that no matter where you sit you will be able to see everyone whos seated at the bar on the silver platter one of the first things we noticed is the instagramfriendly plates that they serve their food in the plates are elliptical and slightly raised on one endandso that when you take all those photos for social media with your phone your plate looks the prettiest crockery aside you must try the spicy kuliye ki chaat if you feel that going all the way to old delhi is a daunting task get the aloo aur khumani ki tikki if you want aloo tikki thats both spicy and sweet with candied apricot on top they also have some really nice channa keema samosa on the menu that has a magenta colour skin owing to the beetroot juice they have put in the dough its pretty and tasty but it may just feel a little dry to your mouth next get the rampuri mutton khichda this is one of the nicest things we have had in a while and we can definitely see ourselves wanting to visit soon just for this for the comfort food feels of this dish also get the sabudana khichdi which is a great vegetarian variant raise a toast to they have got a bunch of mocktails and other cold and hot drinks on their menu but we got this really thick oreo shake which in itself is enough for you to keep sipping on throughout the meal its flavoured with chocolate syrup oreos and kitkat and you can identify each of them individually we also got this carrot and beetroot cold pressed juice called the blood bath and their own version of the nonalcoholic bloody mary called gulaabo gulaabo is a slightly milder version of the bloody mary but they had made it a little spicy with the inclusion of green chillies bitter pill the coffee flavoured kerala fish curry is a hit and a miss as people may or may not like getting coffee beans in their mouth while eating fish also it was a tad overdone but that may be preffered by people wholike their fish a little well done they have got only two desserts on the menu and they are the more ordinary items on the menu imagin is a strawberry sorbet thats decorated with freshly cut kiwis and strawberries and served with a small bowlful of their version of the creme brulee the creme brulee was unnecessary and the sorbet was lumpy and way too tart the gajrela mini pies with a wasabi panjiri is essentially a tart shell with gajar halwa topped with oodles of condensed milk and the panjiri tasted like sawdust food for thought in a world where instagramfriendly dishes and decor are becoming the norm the darzi bar and kitchen is doing everything right you must go for the great selection of music and the fun decor head to h55 1st floor outer circle connaught place new delhi say hello at 011 45644700+91 9311714702 pay inr 1500 for two people approx explore the darzi bar and kitchen from london to connaught place newlyopened darzi bar and kitchen brings tailormade fare
