 weber launched in india in january 2016 and we instantly fell in love with their barbeque grill if barbeque was not reason enough weber has brought everything you can possibly need into these by ensuring you can bake roast and even smoke your food making this one the most productive barbeque grill you can get for your kitchen the spitfire barbeque grill weber sets itself apart with the concept of “closedlid grilling” and very rightly so their barbeque grills are classified into three categories charcoal gas and premium while the much adored and oldfashioned charcoal grill might seem difficult to use we can assure you it is not they are easy to use and have a light charcoal system along with charcoal shells that are 100% organic which make this an easybreezy 5 mins process followed by barely 20 mins wait time significantly less that the typical coal available in different sizes and a portable version we highly recommend these the gas grill is even easier to use with knobs attached to control the temperature and different outlets it gives just as good a result but you lose the oldschool barbeque vibe their premium grills will leave you stunned normally used by the hospitality sector these are truly jawdropping available with a rotisserie option it takes grilling to a whole new level if we had a big backyard or lived in a farmhouse we would be grabbing this no questions asked the academy grill academy is the concept pioneered by weber in order educate us about the authentic way of grilling and to make it an everyday product for them to use at home taking customer service to new heights the grill academy in ghitorni mg road gives a very handson experience it allows you to not just learn the process but also experience it keeping the classes in small groups chef melwin pays attention to every person ensuring they absorb the knowledge but also have fun while doing so in fact we tried a class while the indian perception often limits barbeque to tikkas and skewers the class taught us just how much more a grill can achieve especially if its a weber grill starting off with making a pizza you can actually roll the dough spin it around and have a blast we realised how perfect crust can be achieved by this coveredlid grill followed by a roasted full chicken smoked with apple wood we were in awe smoking is such a beautiful technique infusing the meat with flavours without adding spices they even have a list of woods you should be using for different meats and we loved every bit of it since barbequing smoking and grilling was not enough we moved on to baking a banana bread on the charcoal barbeque grill a blasphemy only to be proven wrong about said blasphemy it came out soft and moist even more than the one we make at home in the oven we ended the class mesmerised by the weber barbeque grill range and determined about our christmas gift portable barbeque grill hell yeah explore more here this barbeque grill makes it super easy to roast and toast at home
