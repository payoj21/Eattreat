 this is the first in our series of eattreat sets the table where we will pick a restaurant and give you an entire top to bottom menu to try from this week we have obviously picked one of our favourite bengali restaurants that does a stellar meal if you are starving or even if you want to pick at a plate of appetisers appetiser begin with a hot peas and keema cutlet that comes with a pungent kasundi mustard the keema and peas mince go so well that this is the perfect start to a authentic bengali meal at bong appetit we also tried their beguni platter which comes with three different kinds of fritters every bengali knows the importance of a bhajan batter fry as an evening snack with a drizzle of mustard oil in a bowl of puffed rice do not want to fill yourself up but still have a hearty adda this is your key entree we experimented with 2 kinds of main course meals the first was a traditional meal of shukto rice and begun bhaja shukto is more of an entree which is slightly bitter in aftertaste and yet that is what makes it stand out hot shukto with a plate of rice and potato and eggplant fries are just what you need for a simply homely meal if you are looking for something slightly rich in nature we recommend the keema stuffed potol dolma which is a pointed gourd filled with cooked mince this is the epitome of a rich bengali meal where you have not yet reached the mains and yet are probably already full but looking forward to the rest of course mains vegetarians will absolutely love the chana dal and peas kachori not super heavy this is a celebratory dish that is very satisfying when done right the chana dal is not very liquidy but on the more viscous side with bits of coconut the peas kachori is a traditional way of making kachoris in bengal so you will remember kolkata for sure non vegetarians rejoice we or rather bong appetit bring you luchi and golbari style mutton with a sprinkling of parmesan this is just enough for two but if you are alone and looking for a filling meal then this is exactly the kind of fellfood meal we are into rich and with meaty pieces this mutton will slowly and surely blow your mind sides if you are walking into bong appetite then we insist you try their papad and chutneys these are the bengali equivalent of a salad not really but they are soooo good that you will love gorging on these even when your meal is over dessert ours is a clan that really enjoys its desserts and here too you will find some enchanting traditional sweetmeats with twists we tried the nolen gur icecream which is an icecream that comes with new jaggery with a subtle aftertaste that lingers the baked mihidana might be a trifle too sweet but in small doses we had definitely recommend this explore more about bong appetit here eattreat sets the table for every bengali at bong appetit
