 it must be said that whatever ritu dalmia puts on a plate is worth spending your time money and appetite over we recently checked out depot48 which is placed prominently overlooking the quaint gk 1 nblock market which has all the pomp of mblock and less of the noise and the mexican menu stuns in a nutshell stemming from the depot29 brand of culinary fare depot 48 has a very industrial look of cassette embellishments and brick walls perfect for your acoustic evenings this is a space that is great for a date or a gettogether for musically inclined friends perfect spot the best place to be seated is near the window a corner table from where you can look at the market and all the people milling about this also has a nice view of the bar and this made it easy for us to catch the attention of the staff whenever we needed something the spot also grants you some amount of privacy for all your handholding and playing footsie raise a toast to we can only go on and on about their great cocktails but the three that stood for us we will be revisiting them for sure the gingranate is perfect for those who like the fruity punch and the lemonade is a bonus after a hard days work for those night owls we will definitely recommend the mexican coffee viva mojo tequila shaken with kahlua vanilla syrup fresh lime and ginger ale the old fashioned is as classic as they come so this is a solid pick from the menu on the silver platter they have different mexican menu sections for tacos guacamole quesadillas and burgers but we have a soft spot for their dips we absolutely loved the warm artichoke and spinach dip with the tortilla chips and the hung curd dip that came with the slow roasted pumpkin and jalapeno empanadas was next level if you are a strict nonvegetarian we can recommend the fish empanadas instead though you will be missing out if you have not tried the pumpkin ones we also had second thoughts about eating something healthy but the quinoa salad with pumpkin pomegranate and feta in a honeylemon dressing is tart and perfect for a fresh and light meal if you are looking for something filling any of their tacos will do that job for you especially the pulled pork and refried beans the nonveg sliders are good for a midnight snack and they do not make you feel terrible the morning after but apart from all the food we will talk about the one reason we came to depot48 the waffles the wild berry compote and mascarpone cheese is the most winning dish on the menu and you have to have to try it to know what we are tacoing about bitter pill the mains menu is a little drab for us though we usually make our way here for the tacos and appetisers the usual chicken breasts and fried fish are a standard affair but its really the offbeat items like the jackfruit tostada that stand out for us food for thought come here on a night when they have live music accompanying your meal and you wo not regret it and with the winter in the air we recommend you try their pumpkin dishes as soon as you can the cocktails will tide you over the bad times and the food will add to your good times and we could not ask for anything more explore depot48 here photos courtesy of depot48 depot48â€™s mexican menu puts together coffee cocktails artichoke dips and more
