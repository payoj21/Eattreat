 ever thought of a travel in india armed with nothing impossible you say emmanuel amanny marshall travelled all the way from edinburgh in scotland to our very own delhi with 120 cans of beer that financed his trip if that was not shocking enough well you ought to know that he covered a 5000mile journey in just 6 weeks first things first marshall a native of sydney australia is a seasoned traveller and has been travelling for the last ten years apart from which hes also made a mark as an author of the book travel hackers handbook as a homage to the 18thcentury brewers of india pale ale ipa marshall undertook this trip offering the cans of ipa as payment travel in india without cash is difficult but this is something completely else his journey before leaving edinburgh manny said this is a trip of a lifetime i have been hitchhiking for a long time now and i have seen how beer brings people together in many countries around the world marshall made his way through france germany bulgaria greece austria and the czech republic he depended on the generous contributions of the people to get along like lifts from drivers and shelter for the night when it came to travel in india according to him the people did not expect anything in return and some of them were glad that he had something to offer thankfully for marshall he had the ipa beers in his kitty which according to their founder dougal gunn sharp is one of the most distinctive styles of beer and is loved in many parts of the world so much for globetrotting that sure must have been a task for marshall but being the sport that he is he managed to get it done hope you continue on your journey and inspire others along the way cheers read the full story here photo courtesy of pixabay man travelled from edinburgh to india only bartering 120 beer cans
