 its true to eat green and healthy is boring tasteless and totally not worth the effort most of the times it is overdone oversold and well over but we found something else in the midst of this impenetrable black smog and the burning of firecrackers and stubble we saw a glimmer of green we saw what a lot of you ca not see or do not want to see to eat green is not just about keeping you or me healthy it is about you me and everyone around you its about keeping the environment safe we found out that eating healthy and living a little more consciously can make your surroundings greener cleaner and create the #eateffect first things first and that is exactly what we are going to do for the next two weeks we will be writing about and featuring ways to combat unhealthy eating and eating practices that affect nature adversely we will feature green ngos organisations restaurants and cafes who eat green and are doing their bit to keep our heads above the water before the flood comes crashing in and in our efforts to make green cool again after all #greenisthenewblack we will show you how healthy eating does not need to be boring tasteless and overly tiring we will show you easy ways to combat household refuse and waste we will give you ways of purifying air naturally and most of all we had love to meet you at the great winter picnic on 27 nov come bust some moves with yoga make yourself heard at our talks get eating green or set up a green stall we have something for everyone with music food and activities and we hope you have something for us too if you want to participate in any capacity send us a mail kasturi@eattreatonlinecom live well and eat green come create the #eateffect with eattreat
