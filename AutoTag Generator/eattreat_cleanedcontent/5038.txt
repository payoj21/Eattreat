 kicking off our winter campaign for the next couple of weeks heres presenting everything you have probably ever wanted to know about the elixir of life rum from the likes of colonels and admirals to their ‘brats from the broke college freshers to the seasoned alcohollovers rum and old monk has been a love affair for many and here we are to stoke those fires this winter first things first this is the bottle that has been passed on from generation to generation an acquired taste a culture to cultivate without burning a hole in your pocket so there are three basic reasons why rum continues to be indias favourite alcohol especially when the cold season sets in and then there are more firstly its cheap its not the kind of cheap that will have you worried about alcohol poisoning and yet its pocketfriendly enough that people can partake once a week especially when hercules and old monk are synonymous with indian rum drinking secondly a lot of the advertising when it comes to rum is entirely word of mouth and unlike brands who spend a lot of money on marketing and branding rum just happens to be cheap and versatile enough that people recommend it to one another its the fabric of all weekend drinking and byob parties thirdly its one of the most versatile drinks that there is you can chug rum neat enjoying the flavour of molasses mix it with coke or soda people have their own favourite combinations and they can be as specific as “shaken not stirred” or as generic as “with ice please thanks very much” whats in it for me in fact research says that a lot of alcohol brands in india try to copy the taste of liquor found elsewhere whisky in india is not the same as whisky in europe since a lot of the whisky distilled in europe is made from grains like rice wheat or barley in india whisky is essentially made from what we know as rum yes that blew our collective minds too in india whisky is made from rum a spirit that has been distilled from molasses a byproduct of the sugar making process and then mixed with flavours or a little bit of actual scotch or whisky and we have been fooled have not we in a country like ours it is a bit commendable though that instead of wasting precious food we are using a byproduct to create something we end up loving rum but the thing is rum never pretends rum you can take at face value fermented molasses and aged for years old monk is aged for seven years to make a smooth dark drink that contains about 40 percent alcohol and now they also have a super beer old monk and us while there have been quite a lot of whispers about how old monk and its maker mohan meakin are going under there has been veritable proof that from 1992 to 2012 the per capita consumption of alcohol has increased by a whopping 55% and though rum drinking has gone down there is no actual statistics that old monk is leaving us anytime soon with the winters setting in old monk is the goto drink for a lot of drinkers it makes you feel warm and cosy it does not actually do that but more on that later and is smooth enough for you to welcome in a night of debauchery its also perfect as a remedy for cold and cough when you take a spoonful with lukewarm water for years drinking rum has meant drinking the monk as the oldest distillery in these parts and having a strong army connection more for morale amirite old monk has been hailed as one of the oldest brands that has been supplying a boost to the troops be it in the defence forces or the merchant navy class food for thought video courtesy of switch off films all in all there are a bunch of reasons that make rum special for indians and having a movie about it is not the worst thing but for us it has to be the flavour of nostalgia and the easygoing nature of this drink that has us hooked to this wondrous elixir look out for our #heyrum campaign that will talk about all things rum old monk and winters we have some crazy deals lined up ahead as well have an old monk story that you want to share or a note that you want us to pass on write in to kasturi@eattreatonlinecom you can check out how much we have immersed ourselves in our love for old monk this is what you should be reading and if you just want to go get some rum in your system heres a list of bars you can drink rum at read all our #heyrum stories here #hey rum love old monk this is why indians love to drink rum
