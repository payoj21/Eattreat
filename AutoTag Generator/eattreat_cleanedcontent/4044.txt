 the opening of restaurants focusing on regional indian cuisine seems to have become the trend this year auro kitchen and bar located in the heart of delhi is doing just that but has brought a plethora of flavours that the city is yet to experience in a nutshell auro kitchen and bar has only opened recently but has already become the talk of the town they serve food inspired from the cuisines of the west side of the coastal region of the country but they also serve a few dishes from the northeastern cuisine cherry picked the best place to be seated is anywhere near the periphery of the terrace whether you go in the late afternoon or for dinner the entire vibe of the place is quite chilled out and is also great if you want to host a party raise a toast to the restaurant is yet to get the liquor license so we are quite excited to see what they have up their sleeve for the time being we tried the chocolate pear shake that was not all that stellar but tasted great the flower power iced tea is good too and it tasted like an iced version of the kashmiri kahwa on the silver platter we ca not even begin to tell you how much we loved the pumpkin and coconut soup it was not overly spiced the caramelised onions added to the sweetness and the little pepper that they had put in provided sufficient heat we also loved the vindaloo pork ribs that literally fell off the bone the tandoori mushrooms that were grilled to perfection and the pulled jackfruit fajitas just blew our mind we ended our meal with the very delicious chargrilled gulab jamun with rose mascarpone which was like fireworks in our mouths bitter pill the tingmo in the tingmo hotdog was a little hard and the sausage itself was too dry for the mouth the gunpowder chicken popcorn was just chicken popcorn coated with gunpowder and served with more gunpowder the watermelon iced tea was a little bland and could have done with a little mint and a little more watermelon syrup food for thought auro is a great new place in town that serves delicious regional food from the western coastal region of the country one can explore all the different flavours here that they normally would not find at most restaurants in the city explore auro here coconut kokum and peanuts auro brings flavours of the west coast to delhi
