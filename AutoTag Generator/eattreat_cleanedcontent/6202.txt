 chatpati diary visited flluid hotel mosaic in noida and we tagged along for all the food porn we were overwhelmed by the amazing emphasis put on the presentation flluid came up diverse ideas like the gun powder infused american chowder soup which was served in a skull shaped hip glass topped with gun powder masala first things first we began with a mocktail which was basically orange juice served in a liquor flask and the whole idea of starting our meal with a juice seemed healthy enough following this came in a snack in a miniature iron for us to guess what was inside of it it was a starter which was a puff with healthy mushroom filling we could not guess it though cool it was too small in size and we finished up in one go just keeping the starters light we were served amritsari masala baked fish which was served as small cubes with a slice of cucumber as the base for the cube for the entire snack to go in the mouth as a whole while for the vegetarians on our table it was achari paneer tikka tart this dish was very rich in flavour and spices and served as a canopy of paneer chunks talk about food porn amirite to add further taste to the dishes they had their sauces and dips – mint chutney tom salsa and chili garlic mayonnaise each in a miniature pressure cooker that was absolute insta food porn we were served the caesar salad prepared in mayo olive oil lettuce and other veggies and bread crumbs served in a big edible bun whats more next we were served a house creation of 3 burgers which came with fries in a miniature shopping trolley the speciality about these burgers was that each burger had a specific flavour to it – pink was beatroot green was spinach and the regular we were served the chicken pudina chaat which was typically indian experiments could have been done with this one to make it more interesting but hey chaat is chaat to bring an end to the evening we were served a lip smacking dessert the gulab jamun cheese cake chunks of gulab jamun in english cheese cake along with rasberry cheesecake as a topping given separately in a mini glass to add to the taste we sure enjoyed our trip to flluid explore mosaic hotels more here this article was originally published on chatpati diary featured image courtesy of mosaic hotels flluid brings out food in miniature irons pressure cookers and shopping trolleys
