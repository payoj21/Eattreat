gorgeous i started #baking gluten and dairy free cakes because i wanted a healthier alternative to my sugar addiction was expecting tasteless cakes that i would force my self to eat but to my surprise not only it became a passion but some of the alternatives taste so much better than the ones packed with sugar and this chocolate ganache recipe by @madeleine_shaw_ is just delicious with a twist of
