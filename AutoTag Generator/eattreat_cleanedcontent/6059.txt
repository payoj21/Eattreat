 salt and sandals visited del at roseate house delhi aerocity and took us along quite naturally we were excited and pleasantly surprised at what we discovered was not your usual coffee shop not your usual coffee shop every hotel has a 24 hour allday coffee shop but when you are starting out in an area as competitive as delhis aerocity innovation is the name of the game this is what the newly opened roseate house does with an uber chic modern decor the roseate house might just present an experience which is totally different to the ones present there previously although there a mighty number of new features that i will be enumerating in further posts but the first one truly is the opening of a bistro instead of the usual coffee shop under the able leadership of executive sous chef anuj wadhawan this airy welllit 132 seater restaurant satiates all of your hunger pangs it has both indoor and alfresco dining options with a sky lounge but where this bistro sets itself apart from other coffee shops around town is the presence of changing menus through the day although there is a buffet for lunch but it is totally a la carte for dinner the restaurant draws its name from delhis airport code del and the dishes from all over the world are also anointed similarly a twist on classic dishes photo courtesy of anuj wadhawan but all the ambience aside it is the food of chef wadhawans twist on classic dishes that will make you fall in love with del we start off with a tortellini this one has goat cheese inside it for a dollop of saltiness while he bathes the soft tortellini in an orange butter sauce giving it a typical nutty flavour now most of the italian dishes similar to the tortellini that i have tried are creamy and buttery but chef is again up to his tricks producing a bit of kale along with raisins on the plate to keep it healthy while complementing the flavours now indians are big fans of biryani from across the country indias rich cultural heritage has been linked to its varied flavours of biryani but here is a biryani which is in line with new indias healthy lifestyle the quinoa biryani with its new texture and health quotient is something that is already making the rounds in quite a few upscale restaurants but its chef wadhawans blueberry raita that makes it even more endearing the beautiful pink colour is impressive to the visual sense while the flavours leave a whirlwind on your palate a bhuna kachi mirch ka murgh accompanies it laced with byadgi chili it provides the required spiciness that indians so crave for we end with a huge lemon tart which combines the controlled sweet and sour from the lemon along with some berries the dishes at del roseate house are something that you might have eaten quite a few times but the eccentric addition of flavours by executive sous chef anuj wadhawan is something that you should definitely give a try head to roseate house delhi aerocity cost inr 2500++ for two featured image courtesy of roseate house new delhi this article was originally published on salt and sandals coffee shop del at roseate house aerocity is our pretravel pickmeup
