 our beloved childhood favourite nirulas seems to be back from the dead roughly 2 3 years ago we noticed a surge of nirulas restaurants shutting down the 4 outlets present in gurgaon reduced to zero and while we had known for a while that it was not doing well it was hard to accept the downfall of a brand we grew up with but soon those mutton chops will be back in business first things first everyone has their favourites at nirulas the big boy burgers mutton chop hot chocolate fudge and banana split it is a place brimming with nostalgic memories so when we heard nirulas has managed to strengthen their ground and is now coming back with expansion plans our happiness knew no bounds surely people living around the flickering branches still open like connaught place would not have noticed or missed it but anyone who saw a neighbouring outlet close down knows the pain of craving for a nirulas hcf at night and not being able to get it so what we are saying is they are all prepped to open 5 outlets 2 of which shall be in gurgaon finally along with preet vihar nilothi and vasant kunj and revamping the others making an overall number of 38 outlets citywide we have to say we are quite excited for this comeback hopefully we will be able to reminisce and get some delicious food soon hello mutton chops explore more here photos courtesy of nirulas after shutting shop across delhi ncr nirulaâ€™s is making a huge comeback
