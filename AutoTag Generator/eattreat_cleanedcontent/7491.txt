 we ordered in from asian haus the other day just for a range in routine we love asian food thats for sure so we all picked out some interesting dishes from their menu and it was on its way in a nutshell asian haus is an asian food delivery service that serves chinese thai malaysian vietnamese and japanese food they started the gourmet asian food delivery service back in september 2013 as is with most food delivery outlets they serve their food in plastic dishes but they package everything in boxes made of light corrugated cardboard to avoid spillage on the silver platter we ordered the otak otak which is essentially banana leaf wrapped fish these were probably the best things we had since they were so well done and the flavours from the lemongrass just hit the spot we also got the chargrilled chicken satay which was well done but the peanut sauce that they sent with it did not do justice to how a good satay dip should be we also got the chicken singaporean noodles which was not too bad but it was not anything special either you should get the haus burnt chilli stir fry prawns to go with it the prawns were well done and the flavours from the garlic and chilli make the noodles so much better while the otak otak was amazing the green tea cheesecake was the clear winner it was soft and fresh and tasted faintly of green tea it is just the thing to end your meal bitter pill we were not very happy with the mixed vegetables in black bean sauce it had no flavour profile we wished they had used a little less soy sauce too food for thought asian haus could be your goto place for some delicious asian food whenever you need a break from cooking the food delivery is pretty fast and you can be sure of receiving food thats still warm even after the trip over to wherever you are say hello at +91 9810043556 and +91 9555800100 pay inr 1500 for two people approx explore asian haus asian haus delivers all the flavours of orient to your doorstep in delhi
