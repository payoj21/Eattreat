 its a rare site to see a woman managing a restaurant in old delhis paranthe wali gali but i was lucky enough to witness it myself owning one of the most famous shops in paranthe wali gali mrs sakun sharma is a middle aged woman handling babu ram devi dayal paranthe wale first things first set amidst the hustling and bustling locality of chandni chowk paranthe wali gali as the name suggests is a hub for parantha indian flatbread lovers there are almost ten shops in the street which specialise in different types of paranthas out of these shops almost half are owned by mrs sharmas extended familys members not all of these shops serve paranthas though one of them is a sweets shop having khurchan lassi churned curd and other sweets on their menu the shop was established in 1889 according to the board outside but mrs sharma claims that it is much older than that the shop belongs to her inlaws and she is the sixth generation handling this work she feels proud to tell me that what to order i had gone there with family so we ordered a variety of paranthas ranging from the plain parantha to the mixed vegetable parantha the shop has a large variety to offer banana parantha lemon parantha parat parantha bhindi parantha kaju parantha karela parantha and so much more you just have to name it and they have it we ordered a paneer parantha and badaam parantha to start with while two men prepared them for us one boy served us thalis each the thali had aloo subzi sitaphal subzi aloo matar pickle and saunth in it the saunth had slices of banana floating in it we were served the paranthas a little later let me tell you a very interesting thing about these flatbreads unlike the usual paranthas which are pan fried on a tava these paranthas are deep fried in a pan of hot ghee oil we were served the badaam parantha first which had a filling of chopped almonds salt and red chilli flakes it tasted fine with the sweet saunth but the different elements in the parantha could have blended together better after the badaam parantha we had the parat parantha layered parantha it had thin layers of wheat inside which could be separated easily this looked interesting to me though it did not have any stuffing but it tasted well with the rabri that we had ordered we also had a mixed vegetable parantha it had chopped cauliflower chillies potato and a few other vegetables in the stuffing our paneer parantha and plain parantha were served soon these paranthas tasted well with the aloo subzi dry and the pickle theres one more thing that always manages to add flavour to the north indian cuisine and that is lassi we north indians just love this combination of paranthas and lassi whats more aloo parantha was last on our plate and i liked it second to the paneer parantha the other paranthas had too much salt in them though the paranthas were golden brown and crisp but the stuffing in most of them was not up to my expectations the subzis provided along the paranthas were fine but nothing exceptional but i really liked the paneer parantha and parat parantha with the rabri i would certainly recommend you to try it i would rate the badaam parantha 510 the paneer parantha 710 aloo parantha 710 and the mixed vegetable parantha would only get 410 due to the salt the paranthas cost between inr 30inr 60 so it is not an expensive deal you can try out the other stuffings and probably ask the man who prepares them to add salt according to your taste a meal for two can be had within inr 200 – inr 300 very easily mrs sakun sharma also told me that all her paranthas are equally popular from my personal experience i would say that paranthe wali gali is slightly overrated the variety they offer is the only attractive factor but the taste and quality can certainly be made better i think they can expand the variety by introducing non vegetarian paranthas this will be a great addition on their menu with all the popularity and fame that paranthe wali gali enjoys it is worth a visit for all those who do not hesitate in experimenting with their food and yes do not dare to ask the recipe of your favourite parantha from mrssakun sharma because she is quite secretive about it she will look at you and say “kuch cheezein bataane ke liye nahi hoti” head to shop no505 kucha bulaki begum dariba kalan rd kucha alam chandni chowk new delhi say hello at 099533 03434 pay inr 200 for two this post was first written by piyush nagpal for delhi food walks photo courtesy of wikimedia commons and karela bhindi and lemon parantha at this extraordinary shop in paranthe wali gali
