 going to restaurants to catch up over dinner and drinks on a weeknight has become the norm off late mainly because of the tight schedules that everyone has and since weekends are more about ‘me time instead of ‘we time after stories gurgaon is a new restaurant that has opened very close to the iffco chowk metro station it is great for catching up with especially when you have been looking for places near the metro to do so in a nutshell after stories is a microbrewery that serves north indian continental and european food the brewery itself has no particular theme and the overall design of the place is a little confusing since there are so many patterns everywhere the restaurant is built over three floors with the full bar in the basement and the microbrewery set up on the first floorthe restaurant has the capacity to serve to about 200250 pax at a time perfect spot we love seating arrangements near windows for natural light and so for us the perfect place to sit here was at the first floor near the windows the place is not too crowded on a weekday evening so one can easily sit here to catch up over drinks and dinner on the silver platter the chef brought us an assortment of different vegetarian and nonvegetarian starters for us to sample from and we loved the rajma galouti with the rajma dip the dahi stuffed palak ke kebab was also really nice and soft and warm even after we took our own time with the photographs they also got us tawa meat with crispy bread which we loved because the mutton was well done and was flavoured with warm spices the mutton puff roll was encased in a puff pastry which was exactly the right kind of flakyandbut did not create a mess while we cut through it we also like the baked chicken tikka in a puff pastry which was a lot like quiche for mains they brought us a plate of blueberry pulao with lamb shanks this you have to try as soon as possible even if it means that you go all the way to iffco chowk the lamb was on the bone and was super soft it owed its flavour and softness to the 8 hours that it had been cooked for at no more that 75°f the blueberry pulao is great on its own but is overshadowed by the awesomeness of the lamb it does give it a slight sweetness nevertheless they also brought us maggi with mushroom ragout and feta cheese balls which we went crazy about because it was just so good this is probably the only innovation with maggis instant noodles that has impressed us so much it could do without those feta cheese balls though they also got us some old delhi style chicken with khameeri roti which we wanted to polish off but could not because of how full we had gotten we ended our meal with churros andand lemon curd with a jaggery biscotti the lemon curd on the biscotti may have been slightly too tangy for our taste but the churros were fantastic we got both kinds the lunchtime churros which was dressed in a mustard mandarin sauce and clotted cream and the dinner time churros which were dressed in a chocolate ganache raspberry sauce and clotted cream they were both so good the churros looked denseandbut were extremely light you should definitely go with your bae to just get the dinnertime churros on valentines day if you are still confused about what to do raise a toast to we loved that all the drinks that we tried were extremely alcoholic in nature at first it will seem like a normal drink but you get this boozy aftertaste that makes your eyes widen in surprise we tried the blueberry smash which had a gin base and was flavoured with basil and blueberry and pops corn which had popcorn infused vodka and corn flakes infused bourbon with milk and melted chocolate it looked like a milkshakeandbut tasted nothing like one we also tried the red and white varieties of their black cherry sangria the fruits were marinated well and the drink was damn nice you must get this if you love sangria as your goto drink at dinners bitter pill while we loved most of all that we got we did find that some of the appetisers that we were served had no unique flavour profileandand started tasting similar the crispy lotus stems in a kimchi caramel glaze is something that you may or may not like depending on whether you like crispy lotus stems the other items like the aloo vindaloo the rawa chicken the lemon basil fish although well done tasted alike after the first bite of each and we did not even have them one after the other food for thought if its not evident enough we loved their blueberry pulao with lamb shanks and that should be reason enough for you to want to go also the location is quite convenient since it is only a few hundred meters away from the iffco chowk metro station so if you generally travel by the metro instead of braving gurgaon traffic you wo not be too far from one the food here is nice the drinks are incredibly boozy the service is very quick and the staff friendly thats pretty much why anyone visits a restaurant no head to andsco 390 sector 29
