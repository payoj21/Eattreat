 #slap popcornsandcome out with 5 weirdly flavoured super light american popcorn and we tried all of them at the palate fest this time around they are fun new flavours and each of them are intense and they have got a superhero story to back them up they just gave our favourite movie time snack an overhaul 1 sour cream its got this intense sour cream and garlic flavour and almost feels creamy on your tongue it is still crunchy but the flavours are like that you should probably get a few bags of these instead of getting your usual potato chips 2 salty sweet its just the thing when you are tired of getting caramel popcorn and you just want a slight sweetness while still retaining the saltiness of the popcorn you are going to love this one and you probably wo not be able to stop at just one 3 peri fire we had advise you to keep a glass of water with you while you are munching on this but wheres the fun in that peri fire is so hot you can feel the heat at the back of your throat while you are taking breaks between munching make a little dip to make it an even better movie time treat 4 mango punch this one is a little tricky for you will either love it or hate it if you like it you will notice that it has a slight sweet mango pickle flavour and it makes you want to keep munching on this as if trying to reach out to that jar of pickles thats kept on the highest shelf 5 chilli storm this one tastes a little sweet to begin with but has the lingering heat from the chilli lingering on your lips its not as spicy as the one with the peri peri but it gets the job done pay inr 20 per bag explore #slap #slap popcorn has 5 weird flavours including mango punch and peri fire
