 and theres a lot that has been and continues to be written about the benefits of turning vegan but for me it finally boils down to one thing – being accountable for myself being vegan is a choice you make for yourself and for me this is what i chose first things first up to 2012 i was largely unaware of what the word ‘vegan even meant but in april of that year i experienced what i call my ‘wakeup call on 24th april 2012 during a yearly health checkup i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when i learnt of my diagnosis it felt like being handed a life sentence but my instinct told me to steer away from medication fear and determination drove me to make an immediate change to my lifestyle a combination of pranic healing naturopathy ayurveda and exercise became my weapons to better health within a week however i was advised by my doctor to start insulin in order to give my pancreas a rest so i did with the full intention of getting off it at the earliest in june 2012 i started a 21day reversal of diabetes programme with an ngo called sharan sanctuary for health and reconnection to animals and nature the diet called for us to stay vegan during the programme it was during this period that i was exposed to information about the effects of an animalbased lifestyle versus a plantbased one during the course of the program my counts altered so dramatically that i was taken off insulin other participants in the program were able to lose weight normalise their blood sugar and blood pressure lower cholesterol reduce medication or completely get off it in just 21 days effects living the possibility of reversing my bad health i now view the diagnosis as a blessing in disguise it challenged me to become accountable for my health emotionally physically mentally and spiritually so while i chose to go vegan for reasons of health i choose to stay vegan for reasons of accountability the what of vegan vegans live on products of the plant kingdom veganism is compassion in action it is a philosophy a diet and a lifestyle it is an advanced way of living in accordance with reverence for life recognising the rights of all living creatures and extending to them compassion kindness and justice vegans exclude flesh fish fowl dairy products eggs honey animal gelatin and all other foods of animal origin from their diets veganism also excludes animal products such as leather wool fur and silk in clothing upholstery and so on vegans usually make efforts to avoid the lessthanobvious animal oils and secretions in many products such as soaps cosmetics toiletries household goods and other common commodities the why of vegan • vegans enjoy an equitable and ethical relationship between human and other living creatures • it is an enlightened concept of repairing and maintaining health • it aids in spiritual development why i became vegan – meenu nageshwaran tells all
