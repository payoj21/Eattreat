sarson da saag and makke ki roti at kesar da dhaba planning a trip to amritsar and kesar da dhaba is not on the list blasphemy winters are here so you will get piping hot rotis and a creamy sarson da

ram lubhaya aam papar wala the aam papad you will need after all that heavy gorging must come from ram lubhaya aam papad wala we even tried a bunch of digestives from there and we have to say theres nothing like a hint of tamarind post a ravishing meal anardana imli and aam zindabad explore ram lubhaya aam papar wala stuffed kulchas at bharwan da dhaba and kulcha land did someone say stuffed kulchas because we are already drooling you can actually try a couple of place for this treat at either kulcha land or bharwan da dhaba stuffed with cauliflower and freshly harvested radishes the stuffed kulchas here are worthy of story books you can also stop at the all india famous if you are going for the beating retreat at the wagah border pickles from clock tower brand mishri bazaar we spent quite an extended period of time looking for offbeat and fresh pickles the main road near the golden temple proved to be quite dissapointing where they specifically kept only a few generic kinds of pickles so we went exploring and came across this lane full of pickle shops called the mishri bazaar so we had definitely recommend the ghantaghar or the clock tower brand pickles we got a fresh gajar gobhi and shalgam pickle and were definitely eyeing the hot green chilli one as well golden temple guru ka langar and kara parshad it is a moment of complete peace and security to watch the volunteers at the golden temple doing their seva so take a moment or an hour and sit for the guru ka langar because theres nothing really like it the hot gheeinfused kara prasad is also quite popular here so you will have to jostle through the crowds we went at the break of dawn and this was a completely heartwarming experience jalebis at khubi halwaai katra ahluwalia near the golden temple in bazaar bikaner is khubi halwaai katra ahluwalia where you will find fresh off the hot oil the beautiful orange jalebis in the cold weather this is a treat unlike any other head to bazar bikaner katra ahluwalia amritsar picnic at pul kanjari and visit to the border a trip to remember pul kanjari near attari is just off the indiapakistan border with a fascinating history behind its origins pul manjari became a picnic spot for us where we could soak in the hundreds of years of history the feeling of closeness to another country and some ageold tappa music street foods by punjab grill set up the food truck here and we gorged on charga chicken multifarious pickles and kebabs that melted in our mouths but you can also pick up some food from the nearby sarhad restaurant which comes on the way and make a loo pitstop head to attari papad and wadi urad dal papads and spicy wadis are quite popular in amritsar so you wo not have any trouble finding some to carry back home as gifts we were gifted some as well by the punjab grill team and we had recommend you get those hot peppery papads for your evening snack with tea the new dry fruit corner is a good spot to pick some up head to chowk fawara shastri market shastri market amritsar chicken tandoori at beera chicken house not the most fancy spot we love the earthy preparations here the most the chicken tikka tandoori is absolutely heaven sent straight to your car if you are going on a road trip then picking up some savouries from here will stand you in good stead ahuja milk bhandar came to amritsar and did not try the worldfamous lassi thats a regret we honestly do not want on our conscience established near the hindu college we have this bookmarked for any time we need a filling meal but do not want the hassle of ordering in a restaurant a giant tumblr of their lassi will keep you full for hours watch out for that malai on top and do keep the diet for another day head to bk dutt gate dhab khatikan amritsar mutton chaap at adarsh meat shop ask the locals and they will point you towards the right direction but yes this place is worth getting lost over and yes the queue will be long so take some time on your hands the mutton and lamb chaap here is mindnumbingly delicious the spicy meat that will be falling off the bones is what we wish we could have in our city head to c block ranjit avenue amritsar bheja fry at mame da dhaba executive chef gurpreet recreated the authentic bheja fry at our pul kanjari visit the soft fry reminds one of really well done marrow but honestly we are still in food coma to be making any criticisms here but of course if you are queasy theres a lot else on this list to try in amritsar same da dhaba is probably the closest you can get for some amazing ethnic bheja fry head to partap nagar pinni at kanha sweets the pinni and besan laddoos from kanha sweets are perfect for taking back home with you once you are done with your visit they last for ages if stored properly but apart from that the dairy in punjab being so good one of even had a moment of weakness and carried home some fresh paneer so the dairybased sweets and gulab jamuns are a musttry as well head to shop 1 opposite bijli pehalwan mandir lawrence road white avenue amritsar breakfast buffet at ranjit svaasa the breakfast at this 200yearold boutique spa and resort was the only meal that we actually got to sit down and enjoy in all the rush and we are absolutely going to recommend it if you want to start your morning on a great note the fresh guava orange carrot juices will add that pinch of health to your trip the homegrown pickles and dips are also really luscious especially that peanut butter and the fig pickle gajar ka halwa at novelty sweets been around for ages novelty sweets is so famous that the crossing it is established on is called the novelty chowk not as fine as the one your grandmother makes the coarse gajar ka halwa here is more about fresh carrots than about being syrupy sweet come winters you will find us here shovelling spoonfuls of this mewa and khoya laden desi ghee dessert into our mouths they also serve hot pooris is the mornings if you are craving dessert head to 7 lawrence road joshi colony amritsar aam da achaar from barni pickles rangla punjab ended on a wonderful note as we were handed these wonderful pickle jars from barni we got the classic aam da achaar but we do want a taste of the kicker pods one the achaar is wonderfully packed in case you want to gift it to someone back home the taste is reminiscent of summer holidays and pickles drying out in the terrace we promise you will love the haldi and gum berry ones as well explore barni jams and pickles from ranjit svaasa we have mentioned this before but in case you want to pick up a souvenir as well the fig jam gingle pickle and the peanut butter are the winners in the ranjit svaasa kitty in the mornings they will also get you multifarious sandwiches and toasts that you can try these with gajar murabba and quail pickle bater achaar a couple of new things that we tried courtesy the punjab grill team were the gajar murabba as well as the amla and pear murabba winter is the season to try these wonderful preserved fruits and vegetables any of the places near the golden temple will be able to kit you up with jars of these the other new dish we tried was the shikar ka achaar also known as bater or quail pickle chef gurpreet has a secret recipe that we had love to get our fingers on stay and feast at punjabiyat this farm stay right outside amritsar is what the doctor ordered situated in the midst of sarson khets this is where you can breathe fresh air and live in the ethnic punjab environs they serve authentic regional punjabi food for breakfast and lunch with a light dinner they also have a library where you can curl up and read a book and honestly we do not know what can be better explore punjabiyat chiki it was our luck and pleasure that we went during the time of the harvest festival lohri during this time you with find revdi til chikkis peanut and gur chikkis and so much more we were astonished at the giant size of the chikkis we got hold of from the hall bazaar while you will find this at any street shop and we are sure you will love sharing this with your entire group of friends and family fruit cream at lohgarh it has really been a while since we have had even a whiff of this but nostalgia beckons guru di hatti near lohar gate has amazing fruit creams and icecreams they also serve a lemon drink and masala milk so if you get there on a hot day you will be saved while it does not really have any place for you to sit and enjoy the treats are so good that we make a visit any way you can try the different shops in lohgarh for the same bade bhai ka brothers dhaba a spot near golden temple this surely does not look like a dhaba in the middle of hall bazar but thats only because they are just so good that they have expanded they now have valet parking as well the vegetarian food here is tremendous and we are keeping their mango lassi and thali on our toeat list explore brothers dhaba punjab grill street food
