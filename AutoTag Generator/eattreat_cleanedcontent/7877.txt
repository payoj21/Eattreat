 marryam h reshii has been writing about food for almost 30 years 17 of which shes spent being a food critic and a fine food critic she is her word is the gospel for her readers her column in whats hot the weekend supplement of the times of india and her times city food guides exert enough power and influence to send chefs and restaurateurs darting for a mere mention from once being told that food journalism would land her in the gutter to becoming one of the most revered voices of the restaurant and food scene in india reshii has had plenty on her plate to make hers an exciting welltraveled and gastronomically rich lifeand what is the sum total of years you have been eating for a living 15 i suppose no no i started in 1998 so i have been eating for a living for 19 yearsand what role did food play in your early lifeand when i was 11 my sister and me were put into boarding school in nainital as my father had a transferrable job and we were almost nomadic moving from city to city across the country the food we were served in school wasi wo not go as far as to say that it was like dog food because that would be too drasticbut it was not gourmet either as a result of this deprivation i started to keep a diary incidentally i still have it with me this diary was a kind of cheat sheet it contained all kinds of recipes from my friends every time we would return to school after our long winter break i would ask them about the most memorable dishes they ate and carefully note down what they would tell me and while taking down these recipes i used to in my minds palate imagine the taste of all of these amazing meals so while battling lumpy rice and watery dal at the school diner i would try and recreate the taste of those recipes in my mind to fool myselfand i think these were my initial beginnings as a food writer and when i grew up and actually became one identifying flavours and writing about food came very naturally to me because i had been doing it in my childhood did your nomadic childhood give you an understanding of the regional cuisines of india pretty early onand i wish i could say yes but actually i feel i just wanted to eat boarding school kids are always hungry and when i was moving around and eating i did not realise that keema and matar was a very punjabi dish how my mother only taught our cook this in delhi and how in bombay other things were taught and eaten like seafood and fried fish all this bounty was there and i just took it for granted so honestly i did not realise but now i see that thread we really traveled we went to hyderabad chennai all over the place really what of your early beginnings in the work force as a food writer i used to work at business standard it was a pink paper and there were two feature pages a week and six of us competing to get our stories told in those two pages so literally we used to fist fight for our stories to go to print to make matters worse there were times i had to cover mundane things like mining exhibitions and that i could not handle eventually i got a weekly or fortnightly column called ‘gut feeling and thats when i began to take it a bit seriously and everyone was like ‘why are you writing so seriously about food why do not you write fun things but i was deep into the bones of cookery and cuisine and sothis sounds bloody pretentiousi got myself a copy of larousse gastronomique with my first earnings with my second earnings i bought myself a series of books culinaria published by kohnemann theres one volume for every country in europe and the us this cost me rs 3000 which in those days was a lot to spend on a bunch of books actually it was pretty unheard of when my husband heard the price he almost kicked me out of the houseand in fact in my early years as a food writer when i once told one of my bosses that i was going to leave to write more about food i was told that i would starve in a gutter and that when i did i had come crawling back and when that happened they may consider taking me back in i left them in 2000 and since then i have never had the need to starve in a gutter but that is by gods grace thats one way to shut someone up laughs you know i think it was actually like i had a sixth sense of what was going to come i used to wonder why there was not any fuss over food when i started like if you go to rajasthan the food of jodhpur is so different from the food of jaisalmer and the food of the rajputs is so different from the marwaris and so on… like everyone has gathia sev but all the cities have a different way of doing it but no one was really talking about all this and i felt it needed attention and do you think your body of personal work and your contribution to the times of india has done that shine the spotlight on our restaurant scene yes i think so you know at the times of india its like you are given a rolls royce to ride and you are expected to maintain it in a certain running condition and if you do not then the management will step in but its a rolls royce and it will give a certain amount of service what i mean is that our readers are numbered in the lakhs people wake up in london and the first thing they do is to get online and read you on the epaperand on the other hand there is no bigger high than when you meet a chef who tells me that he missed reading my story because it did not come out or was so happy to read a story that did come out or when readers tell you that the column told them about this restaurant that they did not know existed its exciting stuff you know then that people really track you and what you say nobody will come to you and tell you they read your latest piece and walk off they will tell you things like “i hated that place and you were the only one who was able to pick it up” they follow you closely and then a certain amount of objectivity is expected of you if you are happy with everything you see and eat as a lot of the food bloggers these days are then you have sort of lost the plot and what of the times food awards how influential have they been you should see my messages you know everybody and their uncles they ring me sms me mail me and saylisten i hope we are going to get a times food award this year and some of them are not even on the edge of forget excellence but not even on the edge of being average you ca not do this and you cant jockey around you ca not say i am the best look at me i have to tell you that so people come and say we are doing better food and this one time i asked this restaurant owner very randomly about the times award making a difference to him and he just stared at me and said “are you mad people have been coming to us with offers for franchising all over delhi and north india because of the award” so yes it definitely goes a long way for people in the industry were you instrumental in the making of these awards i wish i could say yes but no i have notand is it necessary for a food critic to have some kind of training it would be lovely to do so its lovely to know how a sauce is made or how many types of sauces there arehollandaise bearnaise mayonnaise or what are the ingredients in a brown sauce and so on but if you do not have formal training then do not sweat it when you start off in the first say five or seven years you just taste a sauce and say this is good it happens but after some time as you pay attention to what you eat and when your palate takes over you start to understand why something is good or badand a month ago i was in darjeeling and some of my friends told me to eat at glenarys so i went there and had this mixed grill and the sauce that was served was just hp sauce you ca not do thatand i always actively think about what i eat when i go to any restaurant specially the big 5 stars they think that how can this poor old lady sit down with her notebook and be comfortable but when you keep me company and when you barrage me with questions and information about your kids etc you are taking me away from what i have come for its distracting and nobody gets it so if you ever see me alone in a restaurant its not because i do not have any friends at my age it is because i need to be alone to write and feel what i am eating so please leave me alone and how often do you eat out well during the food guide at least 10 times week monday to friday lunch and dinner are booked and as exciting as it may sound it is extremely exhausting what do you eat when you are not eating for work when i am at home i eat rice and dal and dal and rice i have turned my family into complete maniacs but you know when you are at home and you do not have to think of what you are eating and it does not have to make sense to you and you do not have to dissect it minutely you just want something that fills you up you do not want something that is in the realm of very fine food because after some time you just ca not handle itand what are the things you love about restaurantsand every time i go to a new restaurant my heart beats just a little bit faster out of excitement and anticipation about what i will find when this feeling goes away i will know its time for me to stop doing what i am doing so the other day i had gone to itc grand bharat hotel just outside of gurgaon and they had this jeweled clamp clasped to the edge of the table so women can hang their bags on it so these little details excite me disproportionatelyand and what do you love to hate about restaurants pretentiousness oh my goodness when they say we are going to give you an authentic italian pizza and some ‘peeja comes along with raw capsicum on it it just grates on my nerves do not call it a real italian pizza call it a ‘dilli estyle pizza and serve it with pride do not make an idiot out of your customers i am sorry that just does not workand if you had one thing to say to restaurant owners what would it be i have on thing to say to restaurant owners you are not the cats whiskers many of you especially this new breed thats come up in the last five years do not know food what you do know is balance sheets and that does not really cut itand whats you approach to food criticism i always look for a spark let it be a restaurant in mukherjee nagar run by a sardar father and son which only serves chicken tikka or a five star hotel such as the one we are sitting in right now the imperial hotel i want a spark i want to see something where they have thought out of the box i want novelty in their menu or some glimmer of excellence or some glimmer of wanting to break the mouldand what makes a dish memorable so i will tell you a little story here i went to this place called masala house in sunder nagar the other day it seemed nice enough formulaic almost i noticed on the menu a dish called silbate ka shammi kebab so i though to myself yeah right because nothing about the place suggested that they would even know what a silbata stone grinder is the shammi kebab is basically cooked very gently with minimum spices and then ground on a silbata to keep the reshams of the meat intact most people just serve it as a minced meat which is not what a shammi kebab is and shammi kebab happens to be my favourite dish when made well in its authentic preparation and to my surprise what they served me at masala house was surprisingly the real deal they had actually prepared it on a silbata and i almost hugged the chef for his honesty this kind of thing really gets me and is exactly the kind of thing that makes a dish memorableand what are your favourite places to eat at my favourites are almost always the little holeinthewalls theres a place called paragon in calicut and it only serves north kerala food karimbeen kaala outside kottayam in kerala is an actual toddy shop in bombay there is a place in the paper market that serves a gujarati thalishree thaker bhojanalaya kalbadevi it is owned by someone whos probably crossed 100 years in kashmir it has to be adhoos it is an absolute delight and in delhi i rather like big chill i think they have done a superb job in whatever they do you see a college kid and grandfather therewhole generations of people have eaten there and continue to eat there you know the service will be lousy but the food never disappoints any restaurants that do not live up to the hype in delhi you can say almost the whole of haus khas village is a complete ripoff barring one or two establishment like the terrace at social and also the toddy shopand why do you think theres such a dearth of regional indian cuisine served in restaurants do chefs look down upon the cuisine i do not think its the chefs at all its the whole market in 2000 when i had done the firstever food guide it was common wisdom that if a family went out to eat twice in a month then one of those meals would be indian mainly north indian and the other would be continentalmainly italian or chinese but now there is a whole generation of people specifically the younger generation who on principle do not eat indian food when they go out that is shockingand and then there are also the restaurant owners to blame i once went to a place called xxx cafe only to find it was not a cafe at all and when i asked the server why is this place called cafe he told me that the owner said everyones opening cafes so we will call ours a cafe too so this kind of thing i find to be exceedingly dumb and it should not be encouragedand whats your one hope for the restaurant scene in india you know we have indian food in our dna so really i hope that one day we will have a clear idea about who we are what our background is and what we want in food and i think when we have this clarity is when regional indian food will come into its own i ca not wait for thatand and what of your dreams for the future i would love to help people in getting to explore a tiny little bit of the country either through my writing or by taking people on food journeys for example if you have not been to gujarat then you have not had a chance to savour the brilliance of their vegetarian food its beyond this world and i want people to have these
