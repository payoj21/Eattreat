 with various teacentric startups now beginning to emerge in the country one knows that they have tapped on the right nerve of the indian crowd we indians love chai tea is not a mere beverage for the indians but an emotion that runs high in each family our days start with chai and in most cases they even end on the same note you know you can never go wrong with the good ol chai ‘ kam doodh ‘ less milk ‘ zyaada doodh more milk ‘ bin doodh without milk ‘ paki hui cooked ‘ pheeki without sugar ‘ kadak well cooked are words which are so well ingrained in our vocabulary and understanding on occasions for chai discussions – grave or casual happiness – individual or shared to the ever so famous ‘ chai pe bulaya hai being a metaphor for ‘hey lets get you hitched tea has always taken the centre stage in fact i recall this one instance a few years back in delhi when our family was grieving the loss of a dear one and people had gathered in the house to pay their condolences and respect to the departed now let me take the opportunity to state that i come from a punjabi family and emotions always run high in our families we believe in extremes the extreme euphoria to women beating their chest and creating a show out of it in sad times sigh i for one have been the kind whos is more cosmopolitan in my upbringing never having stayed in one place for too long so yes i am the punjabi equivalent of a ‘probashi‘ bengali now coming back to the incident it was a sombre atmosphere where everyone was grieving the loss of the dear departed one when entered a hefty midaged aunt wearing a hue of offwhite beating her chest and wailing to an extent which almost had me worried that maybe shes next anyway what i could not overlook was the special care she took in carefully selecting her piece of gold jewellery for the ‘occasion please do not ask for the logic behind this this is as punjabi as one could get where even in death you should not leave the opportunity to flaunt because… relatives but the best excuse my choice of words here was when in the midst of her incessant wailing she took sips of tea being served and made a casual remark ‘ chaa te mittha kam hai the tea is low on sugar content and then went back to her overflowing stream of tears as taken aback as i was i could not help but notice how even in death you do not part with the tea the only true marriage is between you and your cup of tea no on chai being the constant companion i too share a special relation with my cup of tea it greets me first thing in the morning stays by my side while i write is the first thing i think of when i am happy or sad and that to me is love although like all indian households i too was not spared by the relatives either when they made absolutely illogical remarks about me being dusky because i have ‘chai oh the things we say and the things we do my maternal uncles wife is an obsessive tea drinker in fact as a child i do not recall a single time when i did not see her with her ‘glass of tea a steel glass carefully placed between jute holder and overflowing with dark very dark tea no wonder shes always brimming with enviable energy but my point is her unique tea drinking habits are now an inseparable part of her identity all of us in the family know that shes not to be included in the regular chai sessions of the family as she will brew her own tea very carefully and then join us for the chai pe charcha whatever we say or think of our modi ji we cannot take away from the fact that he caught indias attention with his emotional ‘chaiwaala‘ background and well most were floored why because of chai i had like to end with this quote “i say let the world go to hell but i should always have my tea” featured photo courtesy of wikimedia commons #teastories the emotions behind chai
