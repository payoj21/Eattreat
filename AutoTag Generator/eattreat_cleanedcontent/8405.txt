 launching a new menu is always a matter of excitement and of course it brings the promise of something brand new and fabulous the thing is we can say all of those things about pickwicks the claridges new menu we found ourselves planted on one of their plush chairs trying out their teatime bites and moreand in a nutshell with a beautiful view of the gardens and the pretty gazeboes and sun shades pickwicks is perfect for a brunch or even a post afternoon lounging with a large selection of pastas salads quick bites and european fare this is probably just the place you need to head to when you want some coffee and a post lunch appetiser that does not fill you up too muchand perfect spot we love all the nooks at this place but we pick a table facing the garden on a sunny afternoon its quite pleasant to watch other diners from the comfortable lull of the airconditioningand raise a toast to we had a wonderfully fragrant bellini and the drinks menu is quite extensive so you can pick from their options of cocktails and mocktails as welland on the silver platter while there is a whole lot to choose from you have to be careful of their very particular timings while we stepped in at about 4pm the lunch menu was already off the table but apart from that you can pick from a wide variety of sandwiches and casual knick knacks the kerala style spicy fried prawns andcome on a pretty green banana leaf and has a typical chutney that adds flavour to good measure the croque monsieur is super filling and the addition of multiple cheeses makes this one a hit for us along with the healthy portions of french friesand you can also pick from the pasta section and go for the carbonara like we did and we can tell you theres nothing better than bacon on a fine weekday afternoon to make you forget your troubles and if you are really not that hungry and just need something to munch on while reading a book the chilli cheese toast is a good betand of course dessert was a fun affair with a crisp apple pie and a very unusual cinnamon icecream tbh we are going back for that icecreamand bitter pill apart from their menu being divided in terms of timings which can be disappointing to someone who is ordering the food is good enough for a light lunch food for thought while we would not recommend the place for a big heavy family affair this is really quite quaint and nice for a quick bite so go here for the chilli cheese toast and stay for the wonderful serviceand head to andthe claridges 12 dr apj abdul kalam road aurangzeb road new delhi say hello at and088267 11551 pay inr 3500 for two people approx explore pickwicksand the new menu at pickwicks has everything cheesy and a stunning cinnamon icecream
